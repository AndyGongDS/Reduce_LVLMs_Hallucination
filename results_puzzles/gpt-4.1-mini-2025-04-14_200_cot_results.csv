"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",D,"REASONING:  
A. Group 1 (①2③) and Group 2 (45⑥): In Group 1, shapes have lines predominantly oriented vertically and horizontally, but figure 3 has two diagonals crossing, which is different. Group 2 has fewer diagonals but figure 6 also has diagonal lines; this grouping seems inconsistent.  
B. Group 1 (145) and Group 2 (236): Group 1 (1,4,5) have complex patterns with intersecting diagonal lines forming shapes inside, while Group 2 (2,3,6) have simpler or more horizontal/vertical dominant patterns. This grouping seems plausible.  
C. Group 1 (①24) and Group 2 (356): Group 1 has figures 1,2,4; figure 1 and 4 have diagonals forming triangles, figure 2 mostly horizontal/vertical lines; figure 2 stands out, so this may be inconsistent. Group 2 (3,5,6) also diverse in patterns.  
D. Group 1 (136) and Group 2 (245): Group 1 contains figures 1,3,6; figure 3 is unique with crossing diagonals, but 1 and 6 have different patterns. Group 2 has 2,4,5, which also vary; this grouping is less consistent.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows a hexagon, but previous shapes in the sequence are polygons with increasing sides: triangle (3 sides), quadrilateral (4 sides), pentagon (5 sides), so the next shape should be a hexagon (6 sides), which fits this pattern.  
REASONING: Option B shows a diagonal division inside a quadrilateral, which doesn't fit the straightforward pattern of increasing polygon sides.  
REASONING: Option C shows a square divided into smaller squares, which doesn't relate to the polygon side increase pattern.  
REASONING: Option D shows a shape with internal diagonals, which doesn't fit the pattern of a simple polygon with an increased number of sides.

"In each square of the maze there is a piece of cheese. Ronnie the mouse wants to enter and leave the maze as shown in the picture. He doesn't want to visit a square more than once, but would like to eat as much cheese as possible. What is the maximum number of pieces of cheese that he can eat?",C,"REASONING: A: 32 - This number seems too low given the layout and potential extensive path through the maze; likely not the maximum.  
REASONING: B: 35 - Slightly higher, but still possibly undercounts the number of reachable squares along a valid path without repeats.  
REASONING: C: 37 - This option fits well with a path that navigates most of the maze's accessible squares from entrance to exit without backtracking.  
REASONING: D: 40 - This seems too high because there are walls limiting movement; visiting all squares is impossible without revisiting.

Michael has two building blocks as shown in <image1>. Each building block is made up of two cubes glued together. Which figure in <image2> can he not make using the blocks?,B,"REASONING: (A) Incorrect, because building this shape needs three cubes stacked vertically, but each block only has two cubes, so he cannot form a vertical stack of three cubes with just two blocks; (B) Incorrect, this shape can be made by arranging two 2-cube blocks horizontally and stacking one cube between them, which is possible; (C) Incorrect, this shape is just a 2x2 square face composed of four cubes in one horizontal layer, and since Michael has two 2-cube blocks, he can place them side by side to form this; (D) Incorrect, this shape is an L shape made by placing two cubes horizontally and two cubes vertically, which can be done with the two given blocks.

"Bruce ciphers words adopting the board demonstrated. For example, the word DVEJ is ciphered as GT WI GH NH. What word did Bruce cipher NQ OH OT WI? ",C,"REASONING: 
A: XOCR - Testing against NQ OH OT WI, no clear match with decipher pattern from the board.
B: DJWS - Corresponds to row/column relations from the ciphered pairs; matches a logical pattern.
C: KQFV - Letters do not align correctly according to the given cipher matrix rows and columns.
D: KFQV - Similar to C, letters do not satisfy the positional rules to match the cipher.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows a person painting, which is a manual, hands-on task unlike the technological setting in the analogy, so it is unlikely to fit the pattern.  
REASONING: Option B shows a hand adjusting a small component inside a device, which is more intricate and technical but does not relate directly to an audio or sound control context, making it less fitting.  
REASONING: Option C shows a hand adjusting an electronic device with tubes and wires, which aligns closely with the audio mixer control panel in Origin' as it suggests manipulating electronic or sound equipment, making it a strong candidate.  
REASONING: Option D shows two people assembling furniture, which does not relate to the theme of technological or sound equipment control seen in the analogy, so it is unlikely.  

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,C,True,True
This diagram in <image1> shows two see-through sheets. You place the sheets on top of each other. Which pattern from <image2> do you get?,D,"REASONING: Option A shows the vertical line correctly aligned and the horizontal line overlapping, but the angled line does not match the overlay of the second sheet.
REASONING: Option B correctly combines the vertical, horizontal, and angled lines of both sheets, showing the overlap of the angled lines from sheet two.
REASONING: Option C shows an incorrect placement of the angled line that does not match the overlay of the two sheets.
REASONING: Option D misses the correct overlap of the angled lines and does not accurately represent the combination of the two sheets.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,B,False,False
Which cube can be made based on the unfolded cube?,A,"REASONING: 
a) The fold would place the two large black triangle shapes opposite each other incorrectly, and the single triangle will not be adjacent as shown in the cube.
b) The large black triangles would be on opposite faces and not match the cube; also, the orientation of triangles does not correspond correctly to the cube image.
c) The triangles align properly, with the two large black triangles adjacent as in the cube, and the single black triangle is correctly placed on the side; this matches the cube.
d) The folding would cause overlap and misalignment of triangles; the single triangle is incorrectly placed relative to the two large triangles for the cube.

Which kite has the longest string?,C,"REASONING: A's string length corresponds to 4 loops on the tail.  
REASONING: B's string length corresponds to 5 loops on the tail, longer than A.  
REASONING: C's string length corresponds to 6 loops on the tail, longer than B.  
REASONING: D's string length corresponds to 4 loops on the tail, shorter than C.  
FINAL ANSWER: C",C,A,True,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING:  
Option A shows someone adjusting a tie on another person, while the original analogy has a single person adjusting their own tie. This changes the nature of the action and role, so it does not match the pattern.  
Option B shows hands tying a knot in a rope, but the original analogy for the rope shows a knot already tied. The corresponding analogy for the rope should be loosening or adjusting the knot (like adjusting a tie), not tying the knot from scratch.  
Option C shows a person adjusting their own bow tie, which corresponds exactly to the original analogy where someone adjusts their own tie. This is a parallel action to the original image and maintains the relationship.  
Option D shows hands tying a complex knot, which, like option B, introduces a new knot rather than adjusting an existing one, breaking the analogy pattern.

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,D,False,False
Rachel made a shape using some black blocks and 112 white blocks. How many of these white blocks cannot be seen in the drawing?  ,D,"REASONING: A: 29 - Counting visible white blocks on the front, top, and right faces and subtracting from the total of 112 doesn't yield 29 hidden blocks; this number is too small.
REASONING: B: 68 - This is a plausible number if the majority of white blocks are hidden inside the cube, but counting visible white blocks suggests fewer visible blocks than required for this number of hidden ones.
REASONING: C: 82 - Counting visible white blocks, it seems about 30 are visible, so 112 - 30 = 82 hidden blocks, which matches the visible count best.
REASONING: D: 75 - This number doesn't align as well with the number of visible blocks deduced from the three faces shown; it is less aligned than 82.

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,C,False,False
"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",B,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because the chairs are facing slightly away but not forming the same angle as the question chairs.  
REASONING: Option B is incorrect because the angle between the chairs is almost straight or slightly diagonal, unlike the question chairs.  
REASONING: Option C is incorrect because the chairs are facing almost directly opposite or slightly angled more than the question chairs.  
REASONING: Option D is correct because the chairs form a specific oblique angle, matching the exact angle arrangement shown in the question image.

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,A,False,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because it shows a horse resting, which does not relate to the comparison of young animals grazing or active, as seen in the analogy.  
REASONING: Option B is correct because the first pair shows a baby goat and a baby horse both grazing; similarly, Option B shows a baby sheep actively jumping, matching the energetic analogy with the baby horse.  
REASONING: Option C is incorrect because it shows a lamb jumping in a wooded area, which breaks the parallel of grazing or gentle activity in an open field seen in the first pair.  
REASONING: Option D is incorrect because it depicts a black horse performing a trick or kick which is unrelated to the gentle, natural behavior seen in the analogy.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,B,False,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",C,"REASONING: A - Putting money in a piggy bank is about saving money, which is not related to the laundry action in Origin'. So this does not fit the analogy based on the first pair.  
REASONING: B - Monks receiving robes does not have a clear connection to the concept of laundry or cleaning, so this is not a suitable analogy completion.  
REASONING: C - The Origin to Analogy relationship shows wringing out a cloth and then the analogy shows someone handling money in a different way (possibly squeezing or counting it). Applying that relation to Origin' (a person handling laundry), the analogous action would involve money similarly handled with some expression, which fits this option better.  
REASONING: D - Sewing is related to clothes but does not relate to the money-squeezing analogy shown in the first pair. This is about repair, not about an analogous action involving money.  

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,D,True,False
"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",D,"REASONING:  
Option A (1,2,3 and 4,5,6) - Figures 1, 2, 3 have symmetrical, simpler shapes primarily with single layered or smaller groups of internal shapes; Figures 4, 5, 6 have more complex or layered internal structures that don't form a clear two-category distinction by simple visible logic.  
Option B (1,2,5 and 3,4,6) - Figures 1, 2, and 5 have triangles or pointed shapes in them; figures 3, 4, and 6 mainly have circles or hexagons; this could be a split by shape type but figure 5 breaks this pattern since it is triangular but might connect better here.  
Option C (1,3,5 and 2,4,6) - Figures 1, 3, and 5 contain central shapes made of circles/ellipses or simple filled shapes forming horizontal/vertical symmetry, while 2, 4, and 6 contain more angular or joined multi-triangle or polygonal shapes, but this is not perfectly consistent.  
Option D (1,3,6 and 2,4,5) - Figures 1, 3, and 6 each have three smaller shapes arranged symmetrically inside, with 1 and 3 having ovals/circles and 6 having a hexagon with internal triangles; 2, 4, and 5 have figures centered on triangle structures or consist of stacked triangles. This option neatly separates based on the triangle-based structures (second group) versus circle/oval and polygon based structures (first group).

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,A,True,False
"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",D,"REASONING:  
A. (1 2 3), (4 5 6) - Group 1 includes 2 which has sharp triangular shapes while 1 and 3 have closed circular segmented shapes; these don't form a consistent pattern, so this grouping is incorrect.  
B. (1 3 5), (2 4 6) - Group 1 has circular closed shapes (1, 3) and 5 which has angular segments; Group 2 mixes angular folded shapes (2) with a square (4) and nested circles (6), inconsistent pattern.  
C. (1 4 5), (2 3 6) - Group 1 contains angular polygonal shapes with segments and squares (1, 4, 5), Group 2 has shapes based on curves and circles with some complexity (2, 3, 6). This splitting seems consistent with closed polygons vs curved forms.  
D. (1 5 6), (2 3 4) - Group 1 mixes polygonal shapes (1, 5) with nested circles (6), Group 2 mixes sharp folded shapes (2) with circular (3) and squares (4), no clear pattern.

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,A,False,False
"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs facing slightly away from each other; the angle is smaller than in the question, so it does not match.  
REASONING: Option B shows two chairs facing somewhat inward but with a wider angle than in the question, so it does not match.  
REASONING: Option C shows two chairs facing each other at a similar angle to the question's chairs, matching their relative direction and spacing.  
REASONING: Option D shows two chairs facing straight forward with no visible angle between them, so it does not match.  

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,C,False,False
A big cube is made up of 9 identical building blocks. Each building block looks like this: <image1>. Which big cube in <image2> is possible?,A,"REASONING: (A) The cube pattern does not match the building block pattern because some blocks show color sequences that cannot be formed by the 3-color linear block; the blocks don't align with the adjacent colors correctly.
REASONING: (B) The cube pattern shows color arrangements consistent with the building block's 3-color linear pattern, with appropriate rotations, making this possible.
REASONING: (C) The cube contains color sequences that break the linear 3-color sequence of the block, making some visible faces impossible.
REASONING: (D) The cube shows color patterns inconsistent with the linear pattern of the building blocks, with color placements that would contradict the block's sequence.

Kathryn's place is 4 kilometers from Rebecca's place. The lane from Kathryn's place to Joshua's place is 9 kilometers long. The distance from the junction to Kathryn's place is as shown. How long is the lane from Rebecca's place to Joshua's place? ,A,"REASONING: Option A (7) - Adding the 3 km from the junction to Kathryn and the 4 km from Kathryn to Rebecca equals 7 km, which matches the path from Rebecca to Joshua through the junction, making this plausible.  
REASONING: Option B (4) - 4 km is only the distance from Kathryn to Rebecca, which cannot be the entire lane from Rebecca to Joshua.  
REASONING: Option C (10) - 10 km is more than the sum of the given distances (3 + 4 = 7), so it doesn't fit the pattern of the roads shown.  
REASONING: Option D (15) - 15 km is too long and not supported by the distances given or the road layout.  

FINAL ANSWER: A",A,A,True,True
"In the Kangaroo constellation, all stars have a number greater than 3 and their sum is 20. Which option shows the Kangaroo constellation?",B,"REASONING: Option A has stars numbered 5, 7, 4, and 6; all are greater than 3, and their sum is 5+7+4+6=22, which is more than 20, so it is incorrect.
REASONING: Option B has stars numbered 5, 8, and 7; all are greater than 3, and their sum is 5+8+7=20, which meets the condition, so it is a possible correct option.
REASONING: Option C has stars numbered 3, 7, 5, 2, and 8; the number 2 is not greater than 3, and the sum is 3+7+5+2+8=25, so it is incorrect.
REASONING: Option D has stars numbered 5, 1, 4, and 9; the numbers 1 and 4 are not both greater than 3 (1 is not), and the sum is 5+1+4+9=19, so it is incorrect.
FINAL ANSWER: B",B,B,True,True
"Lisa needs exactly 3 pieces to complete her jigsaw in <image1>.
Which of the 4 pieces in <image2> is left over?",A,"REASONING: Option A has four knobs on each side, but the jigsaw has two knobs and two holes, so this will not fit.
REASONING: Option B has two knobs and two holes, matching the jigsaw's edge pattern, so this will fit.
REASONING: Option C has three knobs and one hole, which does not match the jigsaw edge pattern of two knobs and two holes.
REASONING: Option D has one knob and three holes, which also does not match the jigsaw edge pattern of two knobs and two holes.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,A,False,True
Which figure is a rotation of the object?,D,"REASONING:  
A is incorrect because the top black circle marker is at the bottom, indicating a 180° rotation, but the positions of the shapes do not match a 180° rotation of the original figure.  
B is incorrect because the black circle marker is on the left side, representing a 90° counterclockwise rotation, but the shape order and fill patterns do not match a 90° rotation from the original.  
C is incorrect because the black circle marker is on the left, indicating a 90° counterclockwise rotation, but the positions of the black star and other shapes do not align with the original figure when rotated 90°.  
D is correct because the black circle marker is on the right side, showing a 90° clockwise rotation from the original and all shapes match perfectly in position, fill, and orientation with the original figure rotated 90° clockwise.

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,A,True,False
"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows a pair of chairs viewed from the side and the back, matching the perspective change in the question.  
REASONING: Option B shows chairs viewed from a side and another side, which is not the same perspective change as the question.  
REASONING: Option C shows chairs viewed from a side and a front-left angle, which does not match the question’s perspective change.  
REASONING: Option D shows chairs viewed from a side and the back but with a different design and angle, not matching the question's exact perspective change.

"Ella wants to write a number into each cell of a 3 times 3 grid so that the sum of the numbers in any two cells that share an edge is the same. She has already written two numbers, as shown in the diagram.
When Ella has completed the grid, what will be the sum of all the numbers in the grid?",B,"REASONING:  
A: 18 - Testing if the sum of all numbers can be 18 does not fit the condition of equal sums on all adjacent edges given the starting numbers 2 and 3 placed far apart, making the average too low.  
B: 22 - 22 might be plausible, but it’s tricky to assign consistent numbers to maintain equal sums on all edges while keeping total 22. Testing finds contradictions.  
C: 26 - Assigning numbers to satisfy equal sum conditions on all adjacent pairs works well with total 26, as 2 and 3 can be balanced around the grid using linear relationships.  
D: 30 - Total 30 would require higher numbers that break the equal sums condition due to the positioning of 2 and 3, making consistent edge sums impossible.

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,C,False,False
"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",D,"REASONING:  
A. 1, 3, 5 and 2, 4, 6 - The first group contains figures with enclosed shapes or segments that look enclosed, and the second group has figures with angular or segmented non-enclosed lines. This seems plausible.  
B. 1, 4, 6 and 2, 3, 5 - Group one has irregular, zigzag or complex shapes, while group two contains more geometric or simpler shapes. This does not clearly fit all figures well, especially figure 6 looks different in complexity.  
C. 1, 3, 4 and 2, 5, 6 - Group one has a mix of both enclosed and angular shapes, group two contains circles and dress-like shapes without consistent pattern. This is inconsistent.  
D. 1, 2, 4 and 3, 5, 6 - Group one contains linear or angular shapes with no curves, group two contains curved or enclosed circular shapes. This categorization matches well: 3, 5, and 6 all have some roundness or enclosed areas, while 1, 2, and 4 are more angular/linear shapes.

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,D,True,True
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: 
A - Incorrect because the first analogy is between a squirrel and a human hunter, so an unrelated human figure standing still does not fit.
B - Incorrect because it shows a person crouching in nature, more a natural activity rather than a hunting scenario linked to the analogy.
C - Correct because it shows an animal (a deer) in a forest environment, analogous to how the human is in the forest in the previous analogy.
D - Incorrect because it shows a small rodent in a different environment (desert), not related to the hunting analogy.

"Jeff represents words applying the board demonstrated. For example, the word DCXEH is represented as AM KF GF GI AF. What word did Jeff represent KS KF LC LF GM? ",B,"REASONING: A: TSMBC - Testing T(6,7) does not match the pattern from the example; mapping does not fit the code KS KF LC LF GM.  
REASONING: B: TCMBS - T(6,7) fails the same check as above; does not align with code mapping in the puzzle.  
REASONING: C: PEQGT - P(2,2) maps consistently on the board to KS, E(4,4) to KF, and so forth, matching the letter pairs perfectly.  
REASONING: D: FHMTK - F, H, M, T, K do not map correctly to KS, KF, LC, LF, GM based on the cipher grid.  
FINAL ANSWER: C",C,B,False,True
"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",B,"REASONING:  
Option A: The pattern in each row shows three triangles inside a hexagon, each with a black dot on one vertex, and an inner smaller triangle with a black dot inside it. In the third row, the last figure needs to complete the pattern by matching the positions of dots and orientation. Option A's dot positions inside the smaller triangle and outside do not match the expected sequence from previous rows.  
Option B: This option places the dots in positions that do not align with the progression of the dots in the prior figures. The outer black dot moves anticlockwise, and the inner black dot moves clockwise in preceding figures, but this option disrupts that pattern.  
Option C: The placement of dots in option C follows the established pattern of the outer dot moving anticlockwise and the inner dot moving clockwise in each subsequent figure. This matches the logical continuation from the second figure in the third row.  
Option D: The dots in option D do not follow the expected progression as both dots seem misplaced relative to the previous figures, breaking the established movement pattern.

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",A,"REASONING: Option A's chairs bend backward in the second image, similar to the question's folding chair shifted from front to side view, but the angle is different from the question's pair.  
REASONING: Option B's chairs differ by front and side rotation but the angle between them does not match the folding chair's specific slant seen in the question.  
REASONING: Option C's chairs show a side view and a slightly rotated angled view, but they are much less tilted compared to the question's folding chair angle.  
REASONING: Option D's chairs show a front view and a rotated side view with the same distinct sharp angle between them as in the question, closely matching the folding chair pair's angle.  

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,B,False,False
"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",A,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs mirrored along a vertical axis, matching the relationship seen in the example chairs' orientation and angle.  
REASONING: Option B shows two chairs that are reversed in color but not rotated or mirrored to match the angle relation in the example.  
REASONING: Option C shows two chairs that are facing the same direction and do not exhibit the angle or mirrored relationship.  
REASONING: Option D shows two chairs rotated 180 degrees relative to each other but not at the mirrored angle relationship depicted in the example.

FINAL ANSWER: A",A,B,True,False
Which of the following options conforms to the pattern given in the figure?,D,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because the pattern of shading and the number of shaded layers does not continue logically from the given sequence.
REASONING: Option B is incorrect as it reverses the shading pattern and does not match the progression of the layers getting lighter.
REASONING: Option C is incorrect because the inner shape is solid black, which does not fit the pattern of the inner shapes becoming less filled over time.
REASONING: Option D is correct because it continues the pattern of alternating shaded layers, with the larger outer layer shaded black, matching the progression from the previous figures.

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,A,True,False
How many blocks are in this 3D tower?,C,"REASONING: Option A (7) – Counting the visible cubes, we see 3 on the bottom layer, 3 in the middle layer, and 1 on the top layer, totaling 7 blocks, so this is plausible.
REASONING: Option B (8) – There is no visible evidence of an additional hidden block to make 8, so 8 blocks seem unlikely.
REASONING: Option C (9) – The structure does not show 9 distinct cubes; fewer cubes are visible.
REASONING: Option D (10) – This number is too high based on the visible blocks and structure; the tower isn't large enough for 10 blocks.

FINAL ANSWER: A",A,D,False,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows a cat reaching for a hand, which is unrelated to the analogy of looking through or capturing something, so it is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B shows a person smelling a flower, which parallels the dog sniffing flowers in 'Origin'' image, correctly mirroring the interaction with the flower, so it is correct.  
REASONING: Option C shows washing a car, breaking the analogy of capture or sensory interaction, thus it is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option D shows a police dog sniffing a car, which does not parallel the 'Origin'' image of a dog sniffing flowers directly; the focus is different, so it is less fitting than Option B.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,B,False,False
"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",A,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because the lines connecting dots do not follow the progressive pattern of the other rows where the number of lines and their configuration change systematically.  
REASONING: Option B is incorrect because it fails to maintain the increasing or logical shift in the angle or placement of lines seen in the previous figures in the third row.  
REASONING: Option C is correct because it continues the pattern where each row shows a set of lines connecting dots that incrementally change, creating a logical sequence in line orientation and position consistent with the earlier rows.  
REASONING: Option D is incorrect because its line arrangement does not align with the established pattern of the other two lines in the third row.  

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,B,False,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: Option A shows a lion cub which relates to the lion in water from the Analogy image and connects more directly to the Origin/Analogy relationship where a person is standing in water analogous to a lion standing in water, so here a child (in Origin') should relate to the lion cub (young lion), but the context of water in Origin and Analogy is key, so simply a lion cub on land doesn't fit the water theme.  
REASONING: Option B shows a girl reaching into water, directly paralleling the Origin where a person interacts with water similar to the lion in water analogy. This fits better with the Origin' showing children by water, suggesting the analogy should show children interacting with water, matching the lion-in-water analogy.  
REASONING: Option C shows children interacting over a fence in a dry setting with no water, which diverges from the watery setting in Origin and Analogy. There is no water, so it doesn't maintain the water related thematic analogy.  
REASONING: Option D shows a lion standing near or engaging with a crocodile in water, which is more complex and diverges from the simple person-to-lion in water analogy in the Origin/Analogy pair, making it less likely the correct completion.  

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,C,False,False
"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",A,"REASONING:  
A: The angle between the two chairs in option A is quite large and open, not matching the smaller, more closed angle in the question image.  
B: The chairs in option B have their backs more angled towards each other, similar to the question image; the angle appears to closely match the given pair in the question.  
C: The chairs in option C face each other almost directly with a right angle, which does not match the more obtuse angle in the question image.  
D: The chairs in option D are arranged almost directly back-to-back, which clearly does not match the question's angled chair arrangement.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,C,False,False
"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs where one is facing slightly left and the other slightly right, matching the angle difference in the question chairs.  
REASONING: Option B shows two chairs facing straight forward with no angle difference, unlike the question chairs.  
REASONING: Option C shows chairs with one facing forward and another facing backward, which does not match the subtle angle difference in the question chairs.

"Every night the wizard Tilim makes the weather forecast for the king. When Tilim gets it right he gets 3 gold coins, but when he makes a mistake, he pays a fine of 2 gold coins. After making the prediction for 5 days, Tilim did the math and discovered that he neither won nor lost coins. How many times did he get the weather forecast right in those 5 days?",B,"REASONING: A: 1 right forecast gives 3 gold coins, and 4 wrong forecasts lose 8 coins (4x2), net -5 coins, so not zero balance.  
REASONING: B: 2 right forecasts give 6 gold coins, and 3 wrong forecasts lose 6 coins (3x2), net 0 coins balance, which fits the condition.  
REASONING: C: 3 right forecasts give 9 gold coins, and 2 wrong forecasts lose 4 coins (2x2), net +5 coins, not zero.  
REASONING: D: 4 right forecasts give 12 gold coins, and 1 wrong forecast loses 2 coins, net +10 coins, not zero.

Chase wants to buy 4 kilograms of oval beads and 5 kilograms of star-shaped beads. How much will he spend? (Unit: $),C,"REASONING: A (14) would mean the total cost is $14, but 4 kg of oval beads at $2/kg is $8 and 5 kg of star-shaped beads at $2/kg is $10, total $18, so $14 is too low.  
REASONING: B (16) is incorrect because the sum ($8 + $10) is $18, not $16.  
REASONING: C (18) matches the calculated total cost of 4 kg × $2 + 5 kg × $2 = $8 + $10 = $18, so this is correct.  
REASONING: D (20) is too high since the total cost should be $18, not $20.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",A,"REASONING:
Option A - The figure in option A contains two diagonals crossing a square, but the missing figure must complete the octagonal pattern formed in the last row consistently; option A lacks the complexity of lines present in other figures in the same row.
Option B - This figure shows a well-defined octagon with extra lines forming diagonals inside, consistent with the pattern that each subsequent figure in rows has more complex inner lines.
Option C - This figure includes fewer or simpler internal lines compared to option B, making it less likely to continue the increasing complexity pattern observed.
Option D - The figure has strong internal lines, but the pattern in the last row suggests the inner lines should connect similarly to option B for symmetry and pattern completeness.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",D,"REASONING: A shows a person eating or tasting something different (lime) similar to Origin' where a man is tasting wine, but the analogy relationship between Origin and Analogy (woman smelling wine vs woman smelling herb) involves smelling, so tasting doesn't match the smelled analogy pattern.  
REASONING: B shows a man smelling wine from a glass, which is the same action as Origin and Origin' (both smelling wine) but does not correspond to the analogy action in Analogy (smelling herbs instead of wine). This does not follow the analogy pattern where the object of smelling changes, so it is incorrect.  
REASONING: C shows a cat sniffing a bottle, which is smelling but by an animal, and the object is a bottle rather than a plant/herb, so it diverges from the human-plant analogy, making this unlikely correct.  
REASONING: D shows a person smelling a green leaf (an herb), which is the same analogy relationship as in Analogy (woman smelling herb) but now with a man (matching Origin' is a man), so D correctly parallels the analogy relationship between Origin and Analogy.  

FINAL ANSWER: D",D,B,True,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows a woman stretching, which does not correspond thematically or behaviorally to the fox's yawn or the person’s expression in the analogy.
REASONING: Option B shows a woman yawning, which matches the analogy of the fox yawning and a person also yawning, maintaining the behavior-based relationship.
REASONING: Option C shows a jumping or pouncing animal (likely a fox or similar), repeating a similar animal action but this does not match the human analogy of yawning.
REASONING: Option D shows a person leaping or dancing, which does not relate to yawning or the context of the fox’s and human’s expressions.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows a 3x3 grid of shapes, which doesn't match the 2x3 layout observed in the sequence, so it's incorrect.
REASONING: Option B continues the pattern logically by showing the same number and arrangement of circles and triangles following the last figure's structure, so it fits the sequence.
REASONING: Option C has too many triangles and does not align with the alternating pattern of circles and triangles seen previously, so it's incorrect.
REASONING: Option D has only circles and no triangles, breaking the established pattern of mixing both shapes in the sequence, so it's incorrect.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows a house-like shape with a triangle on top, which does not continue the pattern of shapes combining multiple geometric elements like diamonds and the flower in the second row.  
REASONING: Option B is a simple truck shape, which introduces a completely different form and does not relate to the geometric and floral pattern seen in the second row.  
REASONING: Option C depicts a complex shape containing multiple elements (a top part resembling a lamp or roof, a star, and another shape), fitting the pattern of combining multiple shapes within each figure in the second set, similar to how the first two figures combine shapes.  
REASONING: Option D shows a shape resembling a core or seed inside a circle but is less complex and doesn't match the composite nature of the previous figures in the second row.  

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,D,True,False
How many right hands are depicted in the image? ,B,"REASONING: Option A (14) - There are not 14 right hands in the image since the total number of hands is less than 14, so this is too high.  
REASONING: Option B (10) - Counting carefully, there appear to be exactly 10 right hands depicted in the image, which matches the count of right-facing hands.  
REASONING: Option C (11) - The count of right hands does not reach 11, so this is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option D (0) - There are clearly right hands depicted, so 0 is incorrect.  
FINAL ANSWER: B",B,B,True,True
How many left hands appear in the image? ,C,"REASONING: 
Option A (1 left hand) is incorrect because there are clearly multiple left hands shown in the image.  
Option B (8 left hands) is incorrect as there are fewer than 8 left hands in the sequence.  
Option C (4 left hands) is incorrect because more than 4 left hands appear in the image.  
Option D (5 left hands) is correct because upon counting all the left-hand emojis, there are exactly 5.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows someone dipping a biscuit into tea, which maintains the pattern of a finger or hand dipping an edible item into a dip or liquid, consistent with the origin pair.  
REASONING: Option B shows a similar dipping action but with the item being dipped being bread and a green dipping sauce, which matches the original theme of dipping a food item in a dip, maintaining the pattern well.  
REASONING: Option C shows a baby lying down, which does not relate to dipping or eating activity and therefore breaks the established pattern between the first two images.  
REASONING: Option D shows a baby holding a large roll of bread but no dipping activity, which disconnects from the origin and analogy dip-based relationship.  

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,D,False,True
Which of the following options follows the pattern in the given figure?,C,"REASONING: Option A is a distorted 3D shape but does not follow the regular geometric progression from tetrahedron to cube to octahedron, thus incorrect.
REASONING: Option B is a cube, which repeats the second figure and breaks the sequence, so it is incorrect.
REASONING: Option C is an octahedron, matching the third figure, not a new or next shape in the pattern, so it is incorrect.
REASONING: Option D is a more complex polyhedron with more faces, matching the expected progression from tetrahedron (4 faces) to cube (6 faces) to octahedron (8 faces), followed by a dodecahedron or similar with more faces, so it fits the pattern.

"There are white, grey and black squares. Three children use these to make this pattern in <image1>.
First Anni replaces all black squares with white squares.
Then Bob replaces all grey squares with black squares.
Finally Chris replaces all white squares with grey squares.
Which picture in <image2> have the three children now created?",A,"REASONING: 
Option A shows many black and grey squares but does not correspond to the transformations after all three children have made their changes according to the rules.
Option B still contains white squares, but Chris replaces all white squares with grey squares in the last step, so no white squares should remain.
Option C has all squares grey, but the final pattern should have a mix of grey and black squares after all replacements.
Option D corresponds exactly to the pattern after applying all three steps: 
- All black squares replaced by white squares (step 1)
- All grey squares replaced by black squares (step 2)
- All white squares replaced by grey squares (step 3)

In the picture we see three dice on top of each other. The sum of the points on opposite sides of the dice is 7 as usual. The sum of the points of areas that face each other is always 5. How many points are on the area marked X?,C,"REASONING:  
Option A (4): If the sum of opposite sides on a die is always 7, and the sum of the points on the areas facing each other between the dice is always 5, then the face with X must fit that pattern. Since the bottom die shows a face with 1, to get a sum of 5 with the face above it, the facing area must be 4 (5 - 1 = 4). This fits option A.  
Option B (5): If X were 5, the sum with the 1 below would be 6, which violates the sum of 5 rule. Incorrect.  
Option C (6): If X were 6, the sum with 1 would be 7, violating the sum of 5 rule. Incorrect.  
Option D (8): Dice faces only go up to 6, so 8 is not possible and also violates the sum of 5 rule. Incorrect.

"There are three flowers on the back of the left cactus. In total, the cactus on the right has six more flowers than the cactus on the left. How many flowers are on the back of the right cactus?",C,"REASONING: Option A (7) — Total flowers on left cactus = 6; right cactus has 6 more flowers = 12 total on right; if 7 are on back of right cactus, then 5 on front, summing to 12; this fits.
REASONING: Option B (9) — If 9 flowers are on back of right cactus, total would be at least 9; but right cactus has 6 more than left (6+6=12), so front must have 3 flowers (12-9=3); this is possible.
REASONING: Option C (12) — If 12 flowers are on back of right cactus, total flowers on right cactus would be at least 12; but right cactus should only have 12 flowers total; front would be 0 flowers, and this is possible.
REASONING: Option D (14) — If 14 flowers are on back of right cactus, total would be at least 14, which is more than 12 (left's 6 + 6), so violates the condition; incorrect.

Andrea made the pattern in <image1> out of several identical tiles. None of the tiles overlap each other. Which of the following tiles in <image2> could she definitely not have used?,D,"REASONING: A) The pattern is made of small triangles grouped into hexagons; since the pattern is made of tiles without overlaps and looks like one full hexagon shape, tile A is plausible as a unit tile.
REASONING: B) Tile B is only two small triangles; it cannot form the pattern because the pattern shows full hexagonal shapes made of six triangles, so B is too small to fit and form the pattern shape.
REASONING: C) Tile C consists of four triangles but forms an L-shape; this can be used to form the larger pattern by combining without overlaps, so it is possible.
REASONING: D) Tile D is formed of four triangles arranged vertically; it can be placed without overlap and can tessellate to form portions of the pattern, so it is possible.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows people digging a hole, which is an action similar to the analogy of the man digging in the second image, matching the relationship from snow shoveling to digging.  
REASONING: Option B shows a dog sniffing grass which does not relate to the origin' image of dogs in the snow or the action performed by the human in the analogy.  
REASONING: Option C shows a wolf sniffing in the snow, which relates to the snow environment in origin' but does not correspond to an analogous action to digging as seen in the analogy image.  
REASONING: Option D shows a group of people around a grave digging a hole, which is an analogous action to the man digging in the analogy, and matches the concept of dogs in snow (origin') to people digging a hole in the same context.  

FINAL ANSWER: A",A,B,False,True
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows someone polishing nails, which is unrelated to the relationship between submerged statues and the sea otters floating in the water; it does not match the analogy.
REASONING: Option B shows a sea otter floating in water, directly matching the relationship between the Origin (underwater statues) and Analogy (floating sea otters); it fits the pattern of being in water and floating/being aquatic.
REASONING: Option C shows an otter with a pleading gesture, which is a semantic or emotional representation, not matching the physical relationship of being underwater or floating.
REASONING: Option D shows a woman floating on an inflatable in a pool, which introduces a new element (pool, person on float) unrelated to the aquatic animal theme and underwater statues relationship.

Sylvia made a setup using some green bricks and 95 gray bricks. How many of these gray bricks are not visible in the cartoon?  ,C,"REASONING:  
A: 37 - If 37 gray bricks were not visible, then visible ones would be 95 - 37 = 58. Needs verification if 58 gray bricks are visible in the image.  
B: 20 - If 20 gray bricks were not visible, then 75 are visible. Counting visible gray bricks seems too high, given many green bricks interrupt the gray ones.  
C: 64 - If 64 gray bricks were not visible, then 31 are visible. The visible gray bricks in the image appear to be more than 31, so this is unlikely.  
D: 19 - If 19 gray bricks were not visible, then 76 are visible. This seems similar to option B and appears too high when considering the green bricks interspersed.

Counting the visible gray bricks on the 3 visible faces:  
- Front face: 5 rows × 5 columns = 25 total bricks. Gray visible bricks count appears roughly 13.  
- Top face: 5×5=25 total; gray visible bricks also about 13.  
- Side face: 5×5=25 total; gray visible bricks also about 13.  
However, some gray bricks are counted twice at edges and corners. Each corner brick is counted 3 times, edges twice, and faces once.

Number of total bricks = 5×5×5 = 125  
Green bricks and gray bricks combined = 125, with gray bricks totaling 95.  
We can subtract visible gray bricks (approximately counted without overcount) from 95 to get not visible gray bricks.

By careful estimation, visible gray bricks are around 58 (after adjusting for multiple counts). So, not visible gray bricks = 95 - 58 = 37.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: Option A shows a historical photo with horses and people farming, similar to the Analogy image which is an improved or more advanced form of the Origin image with a horse-drawn plow; this matches the relationship between Origin (simple hoe) and Analogy (horse-drawn plow).  
REASONING: Option B shows a man using a modern handheld tiller or hoe, which is similar in effort to the Origin image and does not represent a step forward analogous to the shift seen from Origin to Analogy.  
REASONING: Option C shows a man using a motorized lawn mower, which is mechanized but more for lawn care rather than farming or plowing; it doesn't fit the agricultural tilling context well.  
REASONING: Option D shows a group of people manually working in a field with hoes, but it is not mechanized or representing an advanced step, thus not a good analogy to Origin' for the given pattern.

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs with one viewed front and the other from a slight side angle, but the angle between the chairs doesn't match the question's chairs.  
REASONING: Option B shows two chairs with one viewed front and the other in a strong side profile, but the angle between these chairs is not consistent with the question's chairs.  
REASONING: Option C shows two chairs viewed almost directly from the back with one tilted slightly angled, which closely matches the angle and relative positioning of the chairs in the question.  
REASONING: Option D shows two chairs viewed from the front and back but sitting parallel, not matching the specific angle between the chairs in the question.

"There are two holes in the cover of a book. The book lies on the table opened up (see <image1>).
After closing up the book which vehicles in <image2> can Olaf see?",D,"REASONING: (A) is incorrect because it includes the car and motorcycle but excludes the tractor, which should be visible through the second hole.  
REASONING: (B) is correct because the first hole shows the car and motorcycle, and the second hole shows the tractor, matching the positions of the holes in the cover.  
REASONING: (C) is incorrect because it excludes the car, which is visible through the first hole, and includes the truck which is not visible through the holes.  
REASONING: (D) is incorrect because it shows the motorcycle first, but the first hole includes the car before the motorcycle, and it also omits the car, which should be visible.

REASONING: Option B - This option does not fit the incremental pattern of dots increasing or following the layout seen in the row above; it seems irregular.  
REASONING: Option C - The circles are arranged in a way that does not align with the geometric shape progressions in the previous columns.  
REASONING: Option D - This option has a similar style but the arrangement of circles does not fit the expected pattern as well as option A does.

"The sum of the number in each line, column and diagonal in the 3 times 3 square is always constant. Only two numbers are visible. Which number is missing in field a?",D,"REASONING: Option A (16) – Testing 16 in place of ""a"" does not yield a consistent sum across all lines, columns, and diagonals.
REASONING: Option B (51) – Testing 51 allows the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals to be equal when combined with the given numbers.
REASONING: Option C (54) – Testing 54 results in inconsistent sums in at least one row, column, or diagonal.
REASONING: Option D (55) – Testing 55 leads to contradictions in sums for the visible numbers and their lines or columns.

How many ways are there for the feline to reach the bird if the feline can only move horizontally or vertically towards the bird in the grid? ,B,"REASONING: The feline is currently at the second row, second column (2,2) and the bird is at the sixth row, fifth column (6,5). The feline can only move down or right to reach the bird.

REASONING: To find the number of ways, calculate the total moves required: 4 moves down (from row 2 to row 6) and 3 moves right (from column 2 to column 5), a total of 7 moves.

REASONING: Use combinations to find how many ways to arrange 4 downs and 3 rights in any order: This is ""7 choose 4"" or ""7 choose 3"".

REASONING: ""7 choose 4"" = 7! / (4! * 3!) = (7*6*5)/(3*2*1) = 35.

REASONING: None of the given options (A: 13, B: 15, C: 19, D: 14) match 35, so reassess the positions to confirm.

REASONING: Counting rows and columns carefully again: feline at row 2, column 2; bird at row 6, column 5. Differences: 4 rows down, 3 columns right. Thus, total steps = 7 moves, with 4 downs and 3 rights.

REASONING: Since 35 is not an option, check if the movement is constrained or steps count is limited.

REASONING: The grid has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the feline at (2,2) should move down 4 and right 3 to reach (6,5).

REASONING: After double checking, the correct number of ways is indeed 35, but since it's not an option, and the closest option logically would be one that follows the binomial pattern for a similar but smaller step.

REASONING: Check if instead feline is starting at (2,3) instead of (2,2), then steps would be 4 down, 2 right, with total 6 steps. Number of ways = ""6 choose 4"" = 15.

REASONING: This matches option B (15), suggesting a possible misread in columns.

The boulevard from William's school to Anthony's school is 7 km far. The boulevard from William's school to Felicia's school is 14 km long. The distance from the junction to William's school is as shown. How long is the boulevard from Anthony's school to Felicia's school? ,B,"REASONING: Option A (7): If the boulevard from Anthony to Felicia were 7 km, then the total distance from William to Felicia through the junction would be 5 + 7 = 12 km, which contradicts the given 14 km distance; incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B (11): If the boulevard from Anthony to Felicia were 11 km, then distance from William to Felicia through the junction would be 5 + 11 = 16 km, which is more than given 14 km; incorrect.  
REASONING: Option C (16): If the boulevard from Anthony to Felicia were 16 km, William to Felicia distance (5 + 16 = 21) would be even longer than 14 km; incorrect.  
REASONING: Option D (23): If the boulevard from Anthony to Felicia were 23 km, then the distance William to Felicia would be 5 + 23 = 28 km, not matching the given length; incorrect.  

On rechecking the problem: William's distance to the junction is 5 km. Given William to Anthony is 7 km, and William to Felicia is 14 km:

- William to Anthony equals the path through the junction (5 km) plus the junction to Anthony distance.
- So, junction to Anthony is 7 - 5 = 2 km.
- William to Felicia equals 5 (William to junction) + junction to Felicia = 14 km, so junction to Felicia = 14 - 5 = 9 km.
- Distance from Anthony to Felicia is the sum of junction to Anthony and junction to Felicia = 2 + 9 = 11 km.

Hence, the correct answer is option B (11 km).

Which of the following options has the same pattern as the given figure?,C,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because the pattern of filled and unfilled squares does not match the alternating black and white arrangement observable in the given figure.  
REASONING: Option B is incorrect since the internal white square placement and the surrounding black squares do not follow the same visual rule as the original pattern.  
REASONING: Option C is correct because it replicates the exact pattern of black and white squares consistent with the original figure, maintaining the positional relationships within the grid.  
REASONING: Option D is incorrect as the distribution of black squares and the blank spaces differs from the pattern shown in the first row of figures.

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",B,"REASONING: A shows two office chairs, one facing slightly forward and the other turned significantly to the side, which does not match the specific angular relationship of the question chairs.  
REASONING: B shows two identical office chairs rotated to face opposite directions but remain parallel at roughly 180°, different from the question chairs which are angled but not opposite.  
REASONING: C shows two straight-backed chairs facing each other front-to-back at about 180°, not matching the question chairs' angled positioning.

"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",A,"REASONING:  
A. Group 1 (1,3,4): Figures 1 and 3 have triangles and lines, but figure 4 is a square with diagonal; Group 2 (2,5,6) does not form a clear pattern as 2 is an ellipse, 5 a rectangle with diagonals, and 6 an I-shape; this grouping is inconsistent.  
B. Group 1 (1,3,6): 1 and 3 contain triangles, but 6 is an I-shape with horizontal and vertical lines, different from the others; Group 2 (2,4,5) mixes ellipse and rectangle shapes with different line patterns; inconsistent pattern.  
C. Group 1 (1,2,5): 1 (triangle inside rectangle), 2 (ellipse with horizontal line), 5 (rectangle with diagonals) do not share a clear pattern; Group 2 (3,4,6) includes triangles and shapes but shape 6 (I-shape) breaks the pattern; inconsistent.  
D. Group 1 (1,4,6): 1, 4, and 6 are all polygons composed of only straight lines without internal intersecting lines forming additional shapes inside other than simple diagonals or no diagonals; Group 2 (2,3,5) have ellipses or triangles enclosed inside shapes with distinct internal patterns; consistent categorization.

In how many ways can the monkey reach the feline given that the monkey can only move horizontally or vertically towards the feline in the grid? ,B,"REASONING: The monkey is at row 3, column 4 and the feline is at row 2, column 2 (assuming top-left as row 1, column 1). The monkey must move 1 step up and 2 steps left, totaling 3 moves. The number of ways to arrange these moves is the number of combinations of 3 moves where 1 is ""up"" and 2 are ""left"". This is calculated by the binomial coefficient C(3,1) = 3 ways or equivalently C(3,2) = 3 ways, so 3 is not an option listed.  
Checking the grid again for placement: The feline is in the second row and second column. The monkey is in the third row and fifth column (5th column, 3rd row). So the monkey must move 1 step up (from row 3 to row 2) and 3 steps left (from column 5 to column 2), total 4 moves.  
Number of ways = C(4,1) = 4 ways (ways to arrange 1 ""up"" move among 4 moves).  

Option A (4) matches this calculation.

"Analyze the pattern of changes in the figure below, and choose the appropriate fifth row:",B,"REASONING:  
Option A: Incorrect because the pattern alternates starting with a sun then a heart in the first row, but the fifth row should appear to continue a sequence of mixed hearts and suns distinct from this straightforward alternation.  
Option B: Incorrect because the sequence of symbols does not match the established positional pattern in the vertical columns when considering the previous rows.  
Option C: Incorrect because it breaks the alternating pattern observed in the third and fourth rows, where hearts and suns alternate in a consistent order.  
Option D: Correct as it maintains the alternating pattern vertically and horizontally consistent with earlier rows.

"From the above food web diagram, what would happen to dragonfly if all mayfly die? Note that a green arrow pointing from object A to object B means that A gives B energy to survive.",C,"REASONING:  
A: remains the same - Incorrect. If mayfly nymphs die, the dragonfly loses a food source, so its population likely won't remain the same.  
B: increase - Incorrect. The loss of mayfly nymphs, a food source for dragonfly, would not cause the dragonfly population to increase.  
C: decrease - Correct. Dragonflies feed on mayfly nymphs, so if mayflies die, the dragonfly's food supply decreases, leading to a likely population decrease.  
D: NA - Incorrect. This option is not applicable because the scenario directly affects the dragonfly population.

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs where the first is in profile and the second in a slightly angled perspective, not matching the direct front-to-angled view ratio in the question.  
REASONING: Option B shows the first chair nearly front-facing and the second chair rotated to the side, closely matching the question's pattern of an object viewed first from the front and then from a side angle.  
REASONING: Option C shows a sofa with the first chair completely back-facing and the second at an angled front view, which is the reverse of the question pattern.  
REASONING: Option D shows chairs positioned at dramatic profile and side profiles, lacking the front-to-skewed angle relation present in the question.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: Option A shows a cat winking, matching the analogy of the kitten winking but this does not align with the analogy relationship involving the girl.  
REASONING: Option B shows a woman winking, which matches the girl winking in Origin' and mirrors the analogy of the first girl and kitten, so this fits the pattern of human to human wink.  
REASONING: Option C shows a cat but it is unrelated to the human wink in Origin', so it doesn't match the analogy rule.

REASONING: Option B shows a candle flame, similar to a small flame source but less related to the hot air balloon's size and context.  
REASONING: Option C shows a hot air balloon in daylight similar to Origin, not matching the night lighting seen in Origin', thus does not align with the analogy'.

A man folds a sheet of paper 2 times through the dashed lines and then cuts it through the red line as shown. How many pieces of paper does he end up with? ,B,"REASONING: A: 5 is incorrect because cutting a folded paper twice folded will not yield an odd number of pieces in this scenario.  
REASONING: B: 2 is incorrect because the paper is folded twice, so each cut will multiply the pieces more than two.  
REASONING: C: 4 is possible since folding twice ideally quadruples the sections; one cut through a double fold will produce four pieces.  
REASONING: D: 6 is incorrect because with two folds, cutting once cannot produce six pieces; the number of pieces must be a power of two.

REASONING: Option B shows a person working on a laptop, unrelated to physical touch or massage, so it does not follow the pattern from Origin to Origin' analogically.  
REASONING: Option C shows a person reading or reviewing something, not indicating any physical or massage-related interaction like Origin'.  
REASONING: Option D shows a card being scrubbed or cleaned, but this lacks the human touch or massage aspect of Origin' and is not a good analogy to the first Analogy image.

"Each of seven students has chosen three courses from ten options, and must sit an exam for each of his or her three choices. Two students sitting the same exam must do so at the same time, but no student can sit more than one exam in the same day. The table of choices is given in <image 1>. Find the smallest number of days required to schedule the exams. ",A,"REASONING:  
A: 4 days - Testing if 4 days suffice requires scheduling 10 exams with the constraint that exams sharing a student can’t be on the same day. The maximum number of exams any student takes is 3, so at least 3 days are needed. However, there are many overlaps and the table shows many shared exams among students, making 4 days highly unlikely to accommodate all conflicts.  
B: 5 days - With 5 days, testing feasibility shows that multiple exams that conflict (due to shared students) could fit if exams are spread cleverly, but given 10 exams and overlapping groups, this still seems tight.  
C: 6 days - This gives more flexibility to schedule such that conflicting exams don’t overlap, considering the exam overlaps are quite dense (e.g., exams 1, 9, 10 appear in multiple students’ selections). Having 6 days seems plausible to separate all conflicting exams.  
D: 7 days - 7 days definitely can accommodate the exams because it’s more than the maximum number of exams a student has, but the question asks for the smallest number. 7 seems more than needed given the problem.  

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,B,False,False
Who bucket contains the least water?,D,"REASONING: Bucket A is filled to 7/8 of its capacity, which is a large fraction but the bucket is large, so it could have a lot of water.
REASONING: Bucket B is filled to 5/6 of its capacity, and the bucket is larger than Bucket C but smaller than Bucket A.
REASONING: Bucket C is filled to 5/6 of its capacity, but it is smaller in size, meaning less total water than Bucket B even with the same fraction.
REASONING: Bucket D is filled to 1/2 of its capacity, and the bucket is a medium size smaller than Bucket B but larger than Bucket C.

Since the size of buckets varies, and fractions alone don't determine the amount of water, the key is relative size and fraction. Bucket C and D are smaller buckets. Bucket C has 5/6, Bucket D has 1/2. Even though Bucket C has a higher fraction, its smaller size compared to Bucket D might make total water less or more?

Comparing sizes visually: Bucket C is the smallest bucket. Even though it has 5/6 full, it's a small bucket, so the total water is less than the medium size Bucket D at 1/2 full, and less than bigger buckets with comparable or greater fractions.

Therefore, the bucket with the least water is Bucket C, the smallest bucket but with 5/6 full.

"On a table, five polygon cards are stacked as shown. Each card is numbered according to the color shown at the bottom. The cards are removed one by one from the top of the stack. In what possible order are the cards removed? ",A,"REASONING:  
A: 2-5-3-1-4 — Removing 2 (blue) first is possible as it is on top, followed by 5 (pink) which would be underneath, feasible so far. However, after 5 is removed, 3 (purple) would not be immediately accessible due to overlap, so this sequence is unlikely.  
B: 5-4-1-2-3 — Removing 5 (pink) first is not possible, as it is not the topmost card; blue (2) is above it.  
C: 3-2-1-5-4 — Removing 3 (purple) first is not possible, as it is beneath blue (2) and pink (5), which are on top layers.  
D: 1-4-2-5-3 — Removing 1 (brown) first is feasible, it is the bottom polygon and visible. Then 4 (green) is accessible after 1 is removed. Then 2 (blue) next, followed by 5 (pink) and finally 3 (purple), which matches the visible overlapping and stacking order.

"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",A,"REASONING: 
Option A (1,2,3 and 4,5,6): The first group (1,2,3) contains shapes that look like simple geometric figures with filled or mostly filled areas, whereas the second group (4,5,6) has shapes with more line segments and open spaces. However, 2 and 5 do not align perfectly in pattern, so it's inconsistent.  
Option B (1,3,4 and 2,5,6): Group 1,3,4 consists of simple arc-based shapes, while 2,5,6 consist of shapes with sharp corners or points. This seems plausible because group 1,3,4 share smooth curves and group 2,5,6 have angular shapes.  
Option C (1,2,4 and 3,5,6): Group 1,2,4 all involve curves that are incomplete, open arc shapes, while group 3,5,6 include more closed or pointed shapes. This also fits the pattern well, differentiating open curved shapes from shapes with pointed or more complex structures.  
Option D (1,4,6 and 2,3,5): Group 1,4,6 includes shapes that are curves with some linear connections, but 6 has multiple lines converging; 2,3,5 have more enclosed shapes but 3 and 5 have different styles. The pattern seems less consistent than in B or C.

Comparing B and C carefully, C's division cleanly separates simpler open curved shapes (1,2,4) from shapes with more complex or angular features (3,5,6), which matches the visible design differences clearly.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows a dot pattern that does not align with the previous rows' patterns, so it is likely incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B shows a dot pattern similar in shape and structure to the patterns in the first and second rows, suggesting continuity and following the established pattern, making it a strong candidate.  
REASONING: Option C's dot pattern is more intricate and does not seem to match the simpler and consistent pattern in the first two rows; thus, it is less likely to be correct.  
REASONING: Option D's pattern is more condensed and does not mirror the patterns in the previous rows, making it an unlikely fit.

"On a table, five polygon cards are stacked as shown. Each card is numbered according to the color shown at the bottom. The cards are removed one by one from the top of the stack. The possible order the cards are removed is: ",C,"REASONING:  
A: 2-4-1-3-5 - The bottom card is purple (5), so it must be removed last; here, 5 is last, which fits, but 2 corresponds to green, which is second from bottom, so it cannot be removed first. Incorrect.  
B: 1-4-3-2-5 - 1 is pink, which is third card from bottom (middle), so it cannot be removed first. Incorrect.  
C: 2-1-4-3-5 - 2 is green (second from bottom), cannot be removed first. Incorrect.  
D: 1-2-3-5-4 - 1 is pink (middle), cannot be removed first. Incorrect.

Analyzing carefully: The stack order from bottom to top by color/index is: 5 (purple), 2 (green), 1 (pink), 3 (red), 4 (blue). The card on top is blue (4), so the top card (4) must be removed first. Only option A starts with 2, which is wrong, but none begin with 4. So, re-examining:

Stack order bottom to top: 5 (purple), 2 (green), 1 (pink), 3 (red), 4 (blue). Cards are removed top down: first should be 4, then 3, then 1, then 2, then 5.

So the correct removal order from top to bottom is: 4-3-1-2-5

None of the options matches this sequence.

Re-examining options: A (2-4-1-3-5) has 2 first, which is second from bottom; B (1-4-3-2-5) has 1 first (third from bottom); C (2-1-4-3-5) has 2 first; D (1-2-3-5-4) has 1 first.

Since top card is 4, the first card to remove must be 4, so none of the options start with 4.

Since no options start with 4, maybe the question implies that ""the possible order the cards are removed"" can consider rearrangements.

If it's possible the arrangement is such that the removal order is 1-4-3-2-5 (B), this might correspond to the correct order if we interpret the numbers attached to colors differently.

Look at the colors on the bottom that number each card: 

- Pink card labeled 1  
- Green card labeled 2  
- Red card labeled 3  
- Blue card labeled 4  
- Purple card labeled 5

Given from the stack, bottom card is purple (5), then green (2), then pink (1), then red (3), top is blue (4).

Therefore, removal must go from top to bottom in order: 4-3-1-2-5.

Among given options, B (1-4-3-2-5) is close but starts with 1 (pink), which is third from top.

So C (2-1-4-3-5) or A (2-4-1-3-5) starts with 2, which is second from bottom.

D (1-2-3-5-4) ends with 4, which is on top; wrong.

Hence, none of the options matches the expected removal order strictly top to bottom.

Assuming the question implies cards can be partially slid or shifted during removal and the given multiple-choice answer reflects the only viable order in terms of numbers at bottom, option B maintains that the last card removed is 5 (bottom) which is logical.

Thus, B is the only option where last card removed is 5 (bottom card), and the order somewhat approximates a plausible sequence.

"The entire pie seen in the image is divided among several children. Each child receives a piece of pie, and each piece of pie looks identical. What is the maximum possible number of children there? ",A,"REASONING: 
A (9) - There are clearly more than 9 identical pie slices, as the image shows more blue and brown shapes arranged evenly around the circle.
B (11) - The number of identical slices looks close to this, but the pieces do not fit evenly when counting the figures around the circle; 11 does not match the visible count.
C (7) - The number 7 is too small given the visible slices; the pattern repeats more frequently than seven times.
D (13) - The pattern appears to be repeated 13 times, as there are 13 symmetrical segments around the circle based on the blue and brown shapes' alignment.

The sticks are placed on top of each other. Stick 5 is at the bottom. Stick 7 is at the top. The stick in the middle is: ,D,"REASONING: 
A: Stick 6 (red) is above stick 5 (brown) but below stick 7 (light blue), so it cannot be in the middle as it is above the bottom but not central.  
B: Stick 1 (yellow) is below the green stick 3 and above the bottom stick 5, but it is lower than the middle layer; it is on the lower side, not the middle.  
C: Stick 2 (purple) is crossing above the yellow stick 1, but is lower than stick 7 (light blue) and stick 6 (red), so it is not the middle.  
D: Stick 3 (green) is positioned visually between the bottom stick 5 (brown) and the top stick 7 (light blue) in the overlapping order, making it the middle stick.

Some art work can be seen on a square-shaped transparent piece of foil as shown in <image1>. The foil is folded over twice as shown in the diagram. What does the foil look like after it has been folded over twice? Choose the correct option from <image2>,A,"REASONING: Option A shows the shaded parts combined after folding but the top right shaded triangle would overlap incorrectly after the second fold.
REASONING: Option B shows the shaded section in the bottom right corner but only one shaded part appears; folding twice should show two shaded parts.
REASONING: Option C correctly shows two shaded parts in the bottom left and bottom right, matching the folding and overlapping shading after two folds.
REASONING: Option D shows two shaded parts, but one is in the top left corner, which doesn't correspond to the folding pattern shown.

"Peter places three building blocks on a table, as shown in <image1>. What does he see when he is looking at them from above? Choose the correct option from <image2>.",C,"REASONING: Option A correctly shows the long rectangular block with the smaller rectangular block placed at the right end, and the circular block positioned below the long block but more centered, matching the arrangement seen from above.  
REASONING: Option B shows the circular block misplaced to the far left, which does not correspond to the attached position under the long block seen in the top view.  
REASONING: Option C places the circular block more to the center, but the smaller rectangular block is not aligned correctly; it is shifted which does not match the original setup.  
REASONING: Option D shows the circular block incorrectly positioned to the far right below the smaller block, which contradicts the original layout.

"At each of the vertices of a cube sits a Bunchkin. Two Bunchkins are said to be adjacent if and only if they sit at either end of one of the cube's edges. Each Bunchkin is either a 'truther', who always tells the truth, or a 'liar', who always lies. All eight Bunchkins say 'I am adjacent to exactly two liars'. What is the maximum number of Bunchkins who are telling the truth?",C,"REASONING:  
A: 2 truthers — With only 2 truthers, their claim ""I am adjacent to exactly two liars"" would be doubted because truthers must have exactly two liar neighbors; this may be too few to satisfy all conditions.  
B: 3 truthers — Having 3 truthers in a cube structure (each vertex degree 3) makes the ""exactly two liars adjacent"" claim for all truthers tricky because each truther must have exactly 2 liar neighbors out of 3 neighbors, which is plausible but limited in arrangement.  
C: 4 truthers — Four truthers can potentially be arranged so that each truther has exactly two of their three neighbors as liars, and each liar would lie about their number of liar neighbors; this configuration is feasible and consistent with the puzzle's constraints.  
D: 5 truthers — Having 5 truthers would force some truthers to have fewer than two liar neighbors because the total number of liars would be only 3, so not all truthers can have exactly two liars adjacent; hence, this is impossible.

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs positioned so that the second chair is rotated clockwise compared to the first chair, similar to the sample pair, where the second chair is angled to the right compared to the first.  
REASONING: Option B shows the second chair rotated 90 degrees from the first chair, which is a larger rotation than in the sample pair, so the angle does not match.  
REASONING: Option C shows two chairs positioned facing mostly forward with a slight rotation, but the second chair’s rotation is different and smaller in comparison to the sample pair, and is not consistent with the angle relationship shown.  
REASONING: Option D shows the second chair is rotated backwards in a way that does not correspond to the rotation seen in the sample chairs, which face slightly turned to the right in the second image.

"The entire pie seen in the image is divided among several children. Each child receives a piece of pie, and each piece of pie looks identical. What is the maximum possible number of children there? ",B,"REASONING: A (9) - The design does not show a clear 9-fold symmetry dividing the pie into 9 identical pieces, so 9 is unlikely.  
REASONING: B (8) - The pattern clearly exhibits an 8-fold radial symmetry with identical segments repeated 8 times, which suits the pie being divided among 8 children.  
REASONING: C (10) - There is no evident 10-fold symmetry in the pattern, so 10 equal pieces do not align with the visible divisions.  
REASONING: D (4) - While 4-fold symmetry exists in some patterns, this image has more segments than 4, so 4 pieces are too few and do not fit the maximum division.

Choose the correct option in <image3>.",B,"REASONING: Option A (blue circle) cannot be opposite to the kangaroo because the blue circle face is adjacent to the green triangle and brown arrow, and the kangaroo is on the hidden face opposite to the unknown face.
REASONING: Option B (green triangle) is seen next to the yellow star and red square, so it cannot be opposite to the kangaroo as the kangaroo's face is opposite an unknown face, not adjacent to the green triangle.
REASONING: Option C (yellow star) logically fits as opposite to the kangaroo because the yellow star is on a different cube face not adjacent to the kangaroo's face, consistent with the cube's layout and visible adjacency.

Sandra created a stacking toy using 8 pieces. How many pieces will she see from top? ,C,"REASONING: A: 3 is incorrect because the toy consists of 8 pieces stacked directly on top of each other, so more than 3 pieces should be visible from the top view.  
REASONING: B: 1 is plausible because when viewed from directly above, only the topmost piece in a stacked toy is visible.  
REASONING: C: 2 is incorrect because the pieces are stacked vertically, so only one piece would be visible from the top, not two.

"Tom bought a chocolate heart (see the picture) to Mary on her birthday.

How many grams did the chocolate weigh, if each square weighs 10 grams?",C,"REASONING: Option A (120 grams) would mean 12 squares, but counting the full and half squares in the heart indicates more than 12 squares total.  
REASONING: Option B (130 grams) equals 13 squares, which is still less than the number of squares forming the heart when counting all parts carefully.  
REASONING: Option C (140 grams) equals 14 squares. Counting all the squares: there are 12 full squares plus 4 triangle halves that combine to make 2 additional squares, totaling 14 squares in the heart.

How many rectangles of any size are to be found in the diagram pictured?,C,"REASONING: Option A (2) is incorrect because there are clearly more rectangles visible in the image than just two.  
REASONING: Option B (3) is plausible as the diagram shows three rectangles: two smaller rectangles side by side on the left and right bottom, and one larger rectangle on the top right.  
REASONING: Option C (4) is worth considering if we count the overlapping combination as separate rectangles. The large rectangle on the left, the smaller rectangle on the right bottom, the top right rectangle, and the combined figure might be counted.  
REASONING: Option D (5) seems too high as the image only clearly shows fewer distinct rectangles; counting only distinct rectangles without subdividing beyond the obvious ones does not yield five.

How many stars are inside the figure?,C,"REASONING: 
Option A (90) - Counting the stars row-wise and column-wise shows the grid is 10x10, implying 100 stars; so 90 is too low.
Option B (93) - 93 is slightly less than 100, but visually no stars seem missing or outside the figure.
Option C (95) - 95 is close but still less than total visible stars, and no stars seem absent.
Option D (98) - This matches the total count after careful counting by rows and columns; two stars appear just outside the figure boundaries, so total inside is 98.

Victor built a setup using some brown bricks and 39 blue bricks. How many of these blue bricks cannot be seen in the image?  ,D,"REASONING:  
A: 19 - Counting the visible blue bricks in the image, there are 20 visible blue bricks (5 on the top, 5 on the front visible face, and 10 on the side visible face), so 39 - 20 = 19 hidden; this matches option A.  
B: 2 - This would imply 37 visible blue bricks, which is impossible given the 3D arrangement and visible count.  
C: 21 - This would imply only 18 visible blue bricks, fewer than we count; incorrect.  
D: 24 - This would imply only 15 visible blue bricks, fewer than we count; incorrect.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows an otter swimming in a similar pose to the first analogy (human swimming), maintaining the aquatic mammal and swimming theme.
REASONING: Option B shows a seal that is resting on land, not swimming, so it breaks the aquatic swimming analogy pattern.
REASONING: Option C shows a woman posing indoors, unrelated to swimming or water, breaking the pattern.
REASONING: Option D shows a woman riding a horse in water, which is a different activity and breaks the analogy of a similar aquatic mammal swimming.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows a complex overlapping square pattern that differs from the simpler patterns in the first two columns' second row, so it likely does not fit the pattern.  
REASONING: Option B shows a figure with diagonal lines crossing, which might match the pattern of increasing complexity seen in the first two columns, but the first two squares in the second row mainly use horizontal and vertical lines, so this may not fit.  
REASONING: Option C shows a symmetrical square with smaller figures inside, similar in style and complexity to the first two squares in the second row, matching the pattern of adding detail within the square.  
REASONING: Option D has diagonal lines forming an X inside the square, which does not align with the horizontal and vertical lines pattern seen in the first two squares of the second row, therefore likely incorrect.

The sticks are placed on top of each other. Stick 3 is at the bottom. Stick 2 is at the top. The stick in the middle is: ,B,"REASONING: A (7) - Stick 7 is at the front and clearly on top of most sticks, so it cannot be in the middle.  
REASONING: B (5) - Stick 5 is covered by sticks 2, 4, and 7, and it covers stick 6, so it could be in the middle position.  
REASONING: C (4) - Stick 4 is on top of stick 3 but under sticks 2 and 7, so it seems to be above the middle, more towards the top.  
REASONING: D (6) - Stick 6 is at the bottom covering stick 3; also stick 5 covers it, so it is beneath the middle position.  
FINAL ANSWER: B",B,D,True,False
These children are standing in a line. Some are facing forward and remaining are facing backward. How many children are grasping another child's hand using right hand? ,A,"REASONING: Option A (5) - There are 7 children holding hands. To grasp hands using right hands, children must be facing opposite directions. Children 1 and 2 do not hold right hands as one faces forward and the other backward, but they hold left hands. Children 2 and 3 hold left hands followed by children 3 and 4 holding right hands, children 4 and 5 hold left hands, children 5 and 6 hold right hands, children 6 and 7 hold right hands. Only the pairs 3-4, 5-6, and 6-7 use right hands, totaling 3 right-hand grips. So, 5 is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B (2) - From analysis, three pairs use right hands, so 2 is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option C (1) - Three pairs use right hands, so 1 is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option D (6) - Six pairs cannot be right hand grips as only three exist, so 6 is incorrect.

"Anne plays 'sink the ship' with a friend, on a 5x5 grid. She has already drawn in a 1x1 ship and a 2x2 ship (as shown in the picture). She must also draw a (rectangular) 3x1 ship. Ships may be neither directly nor diagonally adjacent to each other. How many possible positions are there for the 3x1 ship?",C,"REASONING:  
A: 6 - If we count carefully, considering the black squares and the rule that ships cannot touch orthogonally or diagonally, 6 possible placements seem too few for the 3x1 ship in a 5x5 grid with the given ships.  
B: 7 - This is a plausible number, but we need to verify all exclusion zones around the existing ships; 7 might be under or over the actual count.  
C: 8 - Given the constraints, 8 possible placements seem reasonable because the 3x1 ship can fit horizontally or vertically in multiple spots avoiding buffer zones around the existing ships.  
D: 9 - This might be too many; with adjacency restrictions, some positions are ruled out, reducing the total possible placements.

Carefully mapping the forbidden zones surrounding the 1x1 ship in the upper-left corner and the 2x2 ship below it rules out several cells. After eliminating these invalid positions for the 3x1 ship, counting the remaining valid placements shows exactly 8 possible positions.

These children are dancing in a queue. A few are looking towards front and remaining are looking towards back. What is the count of children who are holding another child's hand using their left hand? ,B,"REASONING: Option A (6) - Counting left hands holding hands in the image results in 6 children using their left hands to hold another's hand.  
REASONING: Option B (5) - The count of 5 does not match the observed number of left hands holding another's hand.  
REASONING: Option C (7) - The count exceeds the observed number; 7 is too high based on the image.  
REASONING: Option D (4) - The count is lower than what is visible; 4 is less than the number of left hands holding hands.

"Snail quadruplets have gone hiking on a path paved with identical rectangular tiles. The shape and length of each snail's trip is shown below.
How many decimeters has the snail Tin hiked?",C,"REASONING:  
A: 32 dm is less than Pin's 37 dm and Rin's 38 dm, which seems inconsistent given Tin's path complexity looks similar or somewhat between Pin and Rin; so 32 dm might be too short.  
B: 34 dm is reasonably between Fin's 25 dm and Pin's 37 dm, matching Tin's path length visually with the number of segments traveled on tiles, suggesting a plausible fit.  
C: 35 dm also fits well as it is slightly more than 34 dm, which corresponds to the visible length when counting each path segment on the grid and estimating the segment's decimeter length.  
D: 38 dm equals Rin's hike, but visually, Tin's path looks shorter or less complex than Rin's continuous rectangular outline, so 38 dm is likely too long.

A number from 1 to 9 is to written into each of the 12 fields of the table so that the sum of each column is the same. Also the sum of each row must be the same. A few numbers have already been written in. Which number should be written in the grey square?,B,"REASONING:  
A: If the grey square is 3, check sums—row 3 would be 6 + ? + 1 + 3 = 10 + ?, inconsistent with others.  
B: If the grey square is 4, row 3 sum is 6 + ? + 1 + 4 = 11 + ?, no matching sum with rows 1 or 2.  
C: If the grey square is 5, row 3 sum is 6 + ? + 1 + 5 = 12 + ?, which may align with sums of other rows/columns.  
D: If the grey square is 6, row 3 sum is 6 + ? + 1 + 6 = 13 + ?, unlikely to match others given the known numbers.

"Max builds this construction using some small equally big cubes. If he looks at his construction from above, the plan on the right tells the number of cubes in every tower. How big is the sum of the numbers covered by the two hearts?",C,"REASONING: Option A (3) is incorrect because the two hearts cover numbers 3 and 4, whose sum is 7, not 3.  
REASONING: Option B (4) is incorrect because the sum 7 is not equal to 4.  
REASONING: Option C (5) is incorrect because the sum 7 is not equal to 5.  
REASONING: Option D (6) is incorrect because the sum 7 is not equal to 6.

Upon reevaluation, the hearts cover the numbers 3 and 4 clearly shown on the grid, so their sum is 3 + 4 = 7, which is not listed among the choices. Since none of the options match 7, the question might expect the selection based on closest sum below or a misunderstanding.

However, since only the sum ""3 + 4"" visible covered by hearts is 7, and no option matches, I must select the closest valid option or assume a typographical error.

But strictly following the instructions and the given options, none are correct if the sum is 7.

"A large square comprises 16 identical small squares, but some of these small squares are now missing. How many small squares are missing? ",B,"REASONING: Option A (15) is unlikely because if 15 small squares were missing, only 1 would remain, but the image shows multiple small squares present.  
REASONING: Option B (11) means 5 small squares remain; the image shows 5 small squares still present, so this fits well.  
REASONING: Option C (14) means 2 small squares remain, but the image shows more than 2 squares present, so this is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option D (13) means 3 small squares remain, but the image depicts 5 squares present, so this is incorrect.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",D,"REASONING: Option A (cross shape) repeats a shape already in the first row and column and doesn't fit the apparent pattern of combining shapes.
REASONING: Option B (rounded rectangle) introduces a new shape not related to the ones in the question mark's row and column.
REASONING: Option C (a shape resembling a semi-circle or a dome) fits the triangle theme seen in the middle cell of the last row and connects well with the surrounding shapes implying a combination pattern.
REASONING: Option D (star) is unrelated to any shapes in the grid and does not fit the pattern of combining basic shapes.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",B,"REASONING: Option A depicts an artificial cloud, unrelated to fire or lava, so it does not fit the fire-to-tornado analogy.  
REASONING: Option B shows a fire tornado similar to the original analogy image but matches the first analogy image rather than the origin' lava flow.  
REASONING: Option C is a set of illuminated bottles, unrelated to any fire, fire tornado, or lava phenomena, so it does not fit the analogy.  
REASONING: Option D shows a dust or smoke tornado, which fits the analogy pattern—fire (origin) relates to a fire tornado (analogy), so lava (origin') relates to a lava tornado or dust/smoke tornado (analogy').

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows two chairs with the same design but arranged at a slight angle difference, which does not match the question where the second chair is rotated more distinctly.  
REASONING: Option B shows two chairs almost identically aligned, which does not match the noticeable angle difference present in the question chairs.  
REASONING: Option C shows two chairs facing each other with a clear and notable angle between them, closely matching the angle and arrangement of the chairs in the question.  
REASONING: Option D shows two chairs facing the same direction with no angle difference, which does not match the question's angled chair arrangement.

"The image shows a menu of an ice cream store. How many different choices of one size, one flavor, and one topping can be made from the menu?",D,"REASONING: A (3) is incorrect because there are more options for each category; just one size, one flavor, and one topping each would produce more combinations.  
REASONING: B (9) is incorrect because with 3 sizes, 3 flavors, and 3 toppings, the product should be 3×3×3=27, not 9.  
REASONING: C (18) is incorrect because 18 does not equal 3×3×3, which is the total number of combinations available.  
REASONING: D (27) is correct because the number of choices is the product of the number of sizes (3), flavors (3), and toppings (3), which equals 27.  
FINAL ANSWER: D",D,D,True,True
How many plums (see the picture) weigh as much as an apple?,B,"REASONING: Option A (2 plums) is incorrect because the right side shows 8 plums balancing 1 apple, so 2 plums are too few to balance an apple.  
REASONING: Option B (3 plums) is incorrect because 3 plums is less than the 8 plums shown balancing an apple, so 3 plums weigh less than an apple.  
REASONING: Option C (4 plums) is incorrect because 4 plums is half of 8, so 4 plums weigh less than an apple.  
REASONING: Option D (5 plums) is correct because 8 plums balance 1 apple on the right, and on the left 3 apples balance 2 plums, indicating the weight per apple and plum ratio means about 5 plums equal the weight of an apple.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows a dog chewing on a stick, similar to the analogy of the origin dog eating food, but not a direct analogy to the origin image where the dog is sniffing grass, so it doesn't match the pattern of eating or sniffing in a different context.
REASONING: Option B shows a mouse eating something, which fits the pattern of the origin mouse eating food, just like the analogy mouse in the first pair, so it is a potential match.
REASONING: Option C shows a mole sniffing flowers, which does not match the eating action seen in the first analogy; the origin dog is eating, so the analogy should involve eating as well.
REASONING: Option D shows a dog looking sad and not eating, which does not correspond to the eating action in the origin analogy, so it does not fit the pattern.

"Leonie has one stamp for each of the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Using them, she stamps the date of her birthday. How many of the stamps does Leonie use to do that?",C,"REASONING: Option A (4) is incorrect because the date ""15 03 2018"" contains six different digits, so using only 4 stamps is not possible.  
REASONING: Option B (5) is incorrect because the digits used in the date are 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, and 8, which totals 6 different digits, so 5 stamps are insufficient.  
REASONING: Option C (6) is correct because the digits in the date 15 03 2018 are 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, and 8, totaling 6 unique digits, so 6 stamps are used.  
REASONING: Option D (7) is incorrect because there are only 6 unique digits in the date, so 7 stamps are more than needed.

"In a zoo there are already some birds, felines, and monkeys (the numbers are shown in the image). How many more felines does the zoo need so that the number of all the animals is 2 times the number of felines? ",C,"REASONING: A (28) - If we add 28 felines, total felines = 13 + 28 = 41; total animals = 11 + 13 + 29 + 28 = 81, which is not equal to 2 * 41 = 82, so incorrect.  
REASONING: B (31) - If we add 31 felines, total felines = 13 + 31 = 44; total animals = 11 + 13 + 29 + 31 = 84, which is not equal to 2 * 44 = 88, so incorrect.  
REASONING: C (27) - If we add 27 felines, total felines = 13 + 27 = 40; total animals = 11 + 13 + 29 + 27 = 80, which is equal to 2 * 40 = 80, so this is correct.  
REASONING: D (24) - If we add 24 felines, total felines = 13 + 24 = 37; total animals = 11 + 13 + 29 + 24 = 77, which is not equal to 2 * 37 = 74, so incorrect.

What is the possible order of the cards being removed? ",D,"REASONING: Option A (5-2-3-4-1) suggests the green (5) card is on top, but the top card in the image is the pink (2) polygon, so this is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B (3-5-4-2-1) starts with orange (3) on top, which does not match the pink (2) top card shown, so this is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option C (2-1-3-4-5) starts with pink (2) on top, which matches, and the sequence logically follows the visibility of the polygons beneath, so this is plausible.  
REASONING: Option D (2-3-4-1-5) also starts with pink (2) on top, but the order sequence of orange (3) next does not correspond well with the layering shown, especially since orange seems below pink and partially covers blue, making the order less likely.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: Option A shows a person shoveling snow, which relates to clearing snow manually and doesn't match the mechanized clearing shown in the second Origin.

REASONING: Option B shows a bulldozer clearing a forest area, which matches the mechanized clearing context but is related to land clearing, not snow removal.

REASONING: Option C shows a person planting rice in a muddy field, similar to the planting shown in the first Analogy, but doesn't correspond to clearing snow by machine.

REASONING: Option D shows a machine clearing land in a dry field, which matches the mechanized clearing activity as in Origin' and parallels the transition in the Origin to Analogy (from machine work to human activity). Since Origin' is a machine clearing snow, the Analogy should be human activity equivalent, but since none show people clearing snow manually, the closest parallel is mechanized clearing land mirrored in Origin. The intended analogy is mechanized land tilling to human planting, so mechanized snow clearing should relate to mechanized land clearing, making B the best fit.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows people cleaning the street with brooms, which is unrelated to the pull or tugging action in the origin and analogy images, so this is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B shows a dog pulling a person in a wheelchair, mirroring the pattern in the analogy image where a dog pulls a person on a cart; this maintains the ""dog pulling a human"" relationship and thus fits perfectly.  
REASONING: Option C shows people pulling on a rope among themselves, which relates more to a tug-of-war scenario, matching the origin's human tug-of-war scene, but the analogy involves a dog pulling a cart, so this is not a fitting continuation.  
REASONING: Option D shows a dog biting or pulling on a leash attached to a stick, which is a single action and does not reflect the relational dynamic of humans or animals pulling others or carts.

REASONING: Option B shows a sculpture of a person in a similar pose to the analogy sculpture, which matches the origin to analogy relationship as a real child to a child sculpture, so correct.  
REASONING: Option C shows a child drawing, which is an activity, not a sculpture, so it doesn't fit the analogy pattern.  
REASONING: Option D shows a statue but it is not a child, so it does not match the analogy of a child figure, so incorrect.

How many children are grasping another child's hand with their left hand? ,A,"REASONING: Option A (7) - Counting the children who are holding another child's hand with their left hand does not yield 7; this is too high compared to what is visible.
REASONING: Option B (5) - By carefully observing each child, 5 children are indeed grasping with their left hand.
REASONING: Option C (2) - Only 2 children holding hands with their left hand is too low considering the total number of children holding hands.
REASONING: Option D (6) - Counting shows fewer than 6 children grasping others with their left hand, so this option is also incorrect.

- 2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 
- The digit 2 appears once in each number except for 22, where it appears twice.
- So total count = 1(2) + 1(12) + 1(20) + 1(21) + 2(22) + 1(23) + 1(24) + 1(25) + 1(26) + 1(27) + 1(28) + 1(29)
- Count = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13 digits
- Thus option A (11) is too low.
B: Option 12 is less than the count found (13), so incorrect.
C: Option 13 matches the total count calculated above.
D: Option 14 is higher than the count calculated.
FINAL ANSWER: C",C,D,True,False
A monkey can only move horizontally or vertically towards a feline in the grid. How many ways are there for the monkey to reach the feline? ,A,"REASONING: The monkey is located at row 6, column 3 and the feline at row 3, column 6 on a 6x6 grid. Moving only vertically or horizontally towards the feline means the monkey can move up or right only. The monkey must move 3 steps up and 3 steps right to reach the feline. The number of ways to do this is the number of distinct sequences of 3 ups and 3 rights, which equals the binomial coefficient C(6,3) = 20. None of the options given match 20, so we re-examine carefully. 

If we consider the grid indexing differently: the monkey at the bottom row in the third column from the left and the feline at the fourth row from bottom and fifth column from the left (5 steps right and 3 steps up), but the image shows a 6x6 grid with monkey at bottom row 2nd column, feline at 3rd row from top and 5th column from left?

Reassessing the position from the image: 
- Monkey is in row 6 (bottom row), column 2 (second from left)
- Cat is in row 3 (third from top), column 5 (5th from left)

So monkey must move up 3 rows (6 to 3) and right 3 columns (2 to 5) = total 6 moves (3 up, 3 right). The number of ways to arrange 3 ups and 3 rights is C(6,3) = 20.

Since 20 is not an option, let's check if the monkey is in column 3 instead of 2:

Monkey is in row 6, column 3 (counting columns from left): 3rd column from left

Feline is in row 3, column 5 (3rd row, 5th column)

Moves required: Up 3 rows (6 to 3), Right 2 columns (3 to 5)

Total moves: 5 (3 ups + 2 rights)

Number of ways = C(5,3) = 10 (choosing which 3 of the 5 moves are up)

Still not an option.

Try with monkey at column 4 (4th from left):

Monkey at (6,4), feline at (3,5):

Up 3 moves, right 1 move, total 4 moves

Ways = C(4,3) = 4 ways

4 is an option (D).

Therefore, if monkey is at (6,4) and feline at (3,5), the answer is 4.

Given the exact positions in the image, monkey is in the 2nd cell from left on bottom row (which is column 2) and feline in the 5th cell from left, 3rd row from top (row 3, column 5):

Moves: Up 3, Right 3 = C(6,3) = 20, no option.

One more check of grid coordinates:

Grid columns from left to right: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Grid rows from top to bottom: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Monkey at (row 6, column 2)

Feline at (row 3, column 5)

Distance: Up 3, Right 3

Number of paths: 20, not an option.

Is there any obstacle or constraint? No.

Check if diagonals or mixed moves allowed? No, only horizontal or vertical towards the feline.

Are moves restricted in any other way like cannot move through some cells? No.

Thus none of the options match the 20 possible paths. The only plausible option that matches a plausible calculation given a possible off-by-one interpretation is 4 (D).

REASONING: A (6) and B (8) are smaller than 10 or 20, no direct match.

REASONING: C (3) is too small for number of ways to move up 3 and right 3.

REASONING: D (4) matches number of ways if moves are up 3 and right 1.

"A zoo already has some birds, monkeys, and felines (the numbers are shown in the image). How many more monkeys does the zoo need so that the number of all the animals is 2 times the number of monkeys? ",A,"REASONING: 
A: If adding 12 monkeys, total animals would be 28 (birds) + (20+12) monkeys + 4 (felines) = 28 + 32 + 4 = 64; twice monkeys would be 2 × 32 = 64, so this fits the condition.  
B: If adding 8 monkeys, total animals would be 28 + (20+8) + 4 = 28 + 28 + 4 = 60; twice monkeys would be 2 × 28 = 56, which does not match total animals.  
C: If adding 15 monkeys, total animals would be 28 + (20+15) + 4 = 28 + 35 + 4 = 67; twice monkeys would be 2 × 35 = 70, which does not match total animals.  
D: If adding 16 monkeys, total animals would be 28 + (20+16) + 4 = 28 + 36 + 4 = 68; twice monkeys would be 2 × 36 = 72, which does not match total animals.

One chocolate needs 7 coins. There is a sale as displayed in the figure. How many chocolates maximum can Robert buy with 599 coins? ,D,"REASONING: Option A: 97 chocolates would require 97 * 7 = 679 coins, which is more than 599 coins, so it is not possible.  
REASONING: Option B: 126 chocolates would require 126 * 7 = 882 coins, which is also more than 599 coins, so it is not possible.  
REASONING: Option C: 89 chocolates would require 89 * 7 = 623 coins, which is more than 599 coins, so it is not possible.  
REASONING: Option D: 87 chocolates would require 87 * 7 = 609 coins, which is slightly above 599 coins, so initially seems not possible unless the sale provides a discount. According to the sale, for some conditions (like buying 10 chocolates, get a discount as shown by ""55 coins sale"" which likely means 55 coins discount for 10 chocolates), we need to verify effective price. 10 chocolates normally cost 70 coins, but with 55 coins discount, they cost 15 coins, so each chocolate effectively costs 1.5 coins under the sale. This makes 87 chocolates cost approximately 87 * 1.5 = 130.5 coins, which is within 599 coins. So this is the feasible maximum chocolates.

Identical rectangular tiles cover the floor as shown. The length of the shorter side of each tile is 2 units. What is the length of the shorter side of the floor (in unit)? ,D,"REASONING: A: 12 - If the floor shorter side is 12, then it equals 6 tiles of length 2. The arrangement does not fit evenly along the shorter side since some tile segments are longer.

REASONING: B: 14 - If the shorter side is 14 units, this would mean 7 tiles of length 2. Looking at the pattern, no group of tiles aligns properly into an exact multiple of 14.

REASONING: C: 17 - Since 17 is an odd number, and the tile shorter side is 2 units (an even number), the floor length being 17 units is inconsistent with fully tiled floor length by equal rectangular tiles.

REASONING: D: 16 - The shorter side consisting of 16 units means 8 tiles of length 2, which aligns perfectly with the arrangement shown. Tiles fit exactly along the shorter side without overlap or gaps.

A (2): If 2 felines are purchased, new total felines = 8 + 2 = 10, total animals = 24 + 8 + 16 + 2 = 50, 5 times felines = 5 * 10 = 50, matches total animals, so this is plausible.  
B (1): If 1 feline is purchased, new felines = 9, total animals = 24 + 8 + 16 + 1 = 49, 5 times felines = 45, total animals ≠ 5 times felines, so incorrect.

A feline can only move horizontally or vertically towards a bird in the grid. How many ways are there for the feline to reach the bird? ,A,"REASONING: The feline is at the top-left corner, and the bird is at the bottom-right corner of a 5x5 grid. The feline can only move horizontally or vertically towards the bird, so it must move 4 steps right and 4 steps down in some order. The number of ways to arrange these moves is the combination of 8 moves taken 4 at a time (or 4 right moves chosen among 8 total moves), which is C(8,4) = 70, which is not one of the options, so this indicates that the grid size or interpretation needs to be reconsidered.

REASONING: Counting the actual number of grid squares horizontally and vertically shows the feline is 4 cells away horizontally and 4 cells vertically from the bird. The path count is indeed C(8,4) = 70, which is not an option, so perhaps the feline moves only on certain allowed open cells or there are obstacles or additional constraints implied.

REASONING: Re-examining the grid carefully shows there are no obstacles, but the puzzle looks like the feline is on (row 2, column 1) and the bird on (row 5, column 5) in a 5x5 grid, so movement is 3 down and 4 right: total 7 moves, choosing 3 downs among 7 moves, total ways = C(7,3) = 35, still no matching option.

REASONING: The grid is 5x5, feline at (1,1) and bird at (5,5): move 4 right and 4 down, total paths = 70, no option matches. The options are all less than 20, so likely the feline must only move right or down without going backwards, but maybe the movement is constrained to a smaller 3x4 block or the puzzle expects the count of paths avoiding certain restricted moves.

The option that best fits the given pattern is:,D,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because the shape shows a circle divided into four equal parts, which does not follow the progression of the previous shapes transitioning from triangle to 3-part segments.  
REASONING: Option B is incorrect because the figure inside the circle is a pentagon-like shape, which does not fit the simpler pattern of dividing the circle into equal parts seen in the sequence.  
REASONING: Option C is incorrect because it shows a triangle inside the circle, but the pattern is increasing the number of segments within the circle, not repeating a triangle.  
REASONING: Option D is correct because it shows the circle divided into four segments with lines radiating from the center, logically continuing the progression of dividing the circle into increasing equal parts from 1 (triangle), 2, 3, then 4 segments.

Derrick had some 4-ray slices as pictured in the drawing. He attached them together as pictured in the drawing on the right. At least how many slices did he use? ,D,"REASONING: A: 2 - If Derrick used 2 slices, each with 4 rays, the total would be 8 rays. The drawing on the right shows a 12-ray shape, so 2 slices cannot produce this many rays.  
REASONING: B: 1 - Using only 1 slice, which has 4 rays, cannot produce the shape with 12 rays shown on the right.  
REASONING: C: 8 - Using 8 slices would give 32 rays (8 times 4), which is more than necessary for the 12 rays shown in the drawing, so this option is not minimal.  
REASONING: D: 4 - Using 4 slices yields 16 rays (4 times 4), which can combine and overlap somewhat to produce the 12 rays shown. This number matches the minimum number of slices needed at least, given the pattern.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",C,"REASONING:  
Option A has a square with two diagonals plus a rectangle with two diagonals inside, matching a combination of previous shapes in the same pattern.  
Option B is a circle with multiple diagonal crosses that does not align well with the shape transitions in the third row.  
Option C is a square with a large diagonal cross and a rectangle inside, fitting the pattern of combining lines from the first row and shapes in the second row.  
Option D shows a square divided with lines similar to others but lacks the complexity seen in the third row’s progression.

The pattern moves from simple shapes with lines in the first row, to rotated or doubled shapes in the second row, and then combines these transformations in the third row. Option A best completes this progression by combining a square and its diagonal lines from previous rows.

REASONING: Option B (3) is incorrect because more than 3 blue bricks are not visible, given the structure is composed of multiple layers and some blue bricks must be hidden inside.  
REASONING: Option C (4) is correct because by counting the visible blue bricks on the three visible faces and subtracting from the total 9 blue bricks, it appears that 4 blue bricks must be hidden inside the structure.

FINAL ANSWER: C",C,B,False,True
How many ways are there for the feline to reach the bird if the feline can only move horizontally or vertically towards the bird in the grid? ,D,"REASONING: The feline starts at row 2, column 2 (if we index rows and columns from the top-left as 1,1), and the bird is at row 6, column 5. The feline can only move right or down to progress toward the bird. The feline must move 4 steps down (from row 2 to 6) and 3 steps right (from column 2 to 5), making a total of 7 moves (4 downs + 3 rights). The number of ways to arrange these moves is the number of combinations of choosing 3 rights (or 4 downs) in 7 moves, which is ""7 choose 3"" = 35, which is more than any of the options. So I re-examined the grid indexing: if the topmost row is 1, feline is at (2,2), bird at (6,4) or maybe (6,5), but the grid is 6x6, so counting the coordinates more carefully is critical.

Assuming the top-left cell is (1,1):
- Cat is in row 2, column 2.
- Bird is in row 6, column 5.

Number of steps down = 6 - 2 = 4
Number of steps right = 5 - 2 = 3
Total steps = 7

Number of ways = C(7,3) = 35, which is not an option.

Check if the bird is at column 4, not 5.

Looking again, the bird is placed in the second last column (column 5 of 6), row 6.

So total right steps = 3, down =4, total steps 7, ways = C(7,3) = 35.

None of the options is 35.

Check if the feline can only move horizontally or vertically ""towards the bird"", that is can only move right or down. So that assumption stands.

Are the options giving ways enumerated differently?

Reconsider the grid numbering.

Alternative is that grid indexes start at 0.

Then cat is at (1,1), bird at (5,4).

Steps right = 4 -1 =3
Steps down = 5 -1 =4
Same calculation.

So 35 ways.

No option matches 35.

Check if any movement restrictions.

Are the feline's moves only horizontal or vertical, meaning right or down strictly?

It says ""towards the bird"", so moves only closer horizontally or vertically.

No obstacles visible.

Therefore, the number of ways is 35.

Since 35 is not in the option list.

Could the move be only vertical or horizontal, meaning one step per move, cannot move diagonally.

Steps are from cat to bird: 4 down, 3 right, so total steps = 7.

Number of ways should be combinations of 7 moves with 3 rights.

Hence 35.

Given the provided options, none of those are 35.

Is there a misinterpretation?

Check if ""towards the bird"" means can only move right or up or left or down, but only towards the bird.

Check coordinates again:

Cat: 2nd row from top, 2nd column from left

Bird: bottom row (6th), 5th column

Difference in rows = 6 - 2 = 4 (must move down 4 times)

Difference in columns = 5 - 2 = 3 (must move right 3 times)

Hence 7 total moves: 4 downs, 3 rights.

Number of ways = combinations of 7 moves, choosing 3 rights = C(7,3) = 35.

No options.

Check if the feline can only move horizontally or vertically.

Are diagonal moves allowed no? No.

Are moves restricted to only horizontal or vertical (up or left), no, because must move towards bird.

No obstacles.

Possibility: the feline is allowed to move only right and up? No, bird is below, so must move down.

Re-examine the question and options.

The question is: ""How many ways are there for the feline to reach the bird if the feline can only move horizontally or vertically towards the bird in the grid?""

Options: 16, 17, 13, 15

Try to verify if any of these matches the total ways from a different interpretation.

If the feline moves only right or down with no obstacles, total ways should be 35.

If the feline can only move right or down by one step at a time, total ways 35.

Try smaller steps.

Check if the number of ways could be 16:

16 = C(6,3) = 6 choose 3 is 20, no.

Try 15: C(6,2) = 15.

Try 13, no","Try 13, no",D,False,True
The number 4 is reflected twice in <image1>. Which among the options in <image2> should appear in the field with the question mark if we do the same with the number 5?,C,"REASONING: A) This option is the mirror reflection of the number 5, which fits the pattern of ""number 4 reflected"" in both vertical and horizontal directions seen in image1, so it's a strong candidate.
REASONING: B) This option looks like a normal ""2"" rotated, not a reflection of the number 5; it doesn't fit the pattern of mirroring the original number 5.
REASONING: C) This option is a reversed number 5 but appears not flipped properly like the reflected 4 in image1, so it is not the correct symmetrical reflection.
REASONING: D) This option appears like the number 5 rotated or flipped in a way that doesn't match the pattern seen in image1; it is not a proper reflection.

"Each area in the picture on the right should be coloured using one of the colours, red (R), green (G), blue (B) or orange (O). Areas which touch must be different colours. Which colour is the area marked x?",A,"REASONING: Option A (red) is incorrect because the area adjacent to x borders an area marked R (red), so it cannot also be red.  
REASONING: Option B (green) is possible since the adjacent areas are R (red) and O (orange), but we need to check if any adjacent area is green. The G (green) area is separated and does not border x directly, so green may be possible.  
REASONING: Option C (blue) is possible because none of the adjacent areas to x is blue, so blue does not violate any rule.  
REASONING: Option D (orange) is incorrect because the area adjacent to x borders an area marked O (orange), so it cannot also be orange.

A man cuts a sheet of paper through the red line after he folds it 2 times through the dashed lines. How many pieces of paper does he end up with? ,A,"REASONING: A: 4 - After folding twice, the paper layers are quadrupled. Cutting once through all layers creates 4 pieces, so option A is possible.
REASONING: B: 2 - Cutting through the folded paper would not result in just 2 pieces because two folds create more layers.
REASONING: C: 3 - The number of pieces from a single cut through folded layers is typically a power of 2; 3 is unlikely.
REASONING: D: 6 - 6 pieces would require an uneven layering or cutting multiple times, not just one cut after two folds.

In the box are seven blocks. You want to rearrange the blocks so that another block can placed. What is the minimum number of blocks that have to be moved?,B,"REASONING:  
A: Moving only 2 blocks is insufficient because the blocks are tightly packed; at least three need to be rearranged to create space.  
B: Moving 3 blocks could create enough space since some blocks can be shifted, but the configuration looks very tight.  
C: Moving 4 blocks seems the minimum needed to properly free enough space for the additional block based on the arrangement and overlaps.  
D: Moving 5 blocks is more extensive than necessary and not minimal.

"Anna has <image1>.
Barbara gave Eva <image2>.
Josef has a <image3>.
Bob has <image4>.
Who is Barbara?
<image5>",D,"REASONING:  
A - The man in option A wears glasses which match the item Bob has (image4), not Barbara. So incorrect.  
B - The girl in option B wears a necklace with a butterfly, matching the necklace Barbara gave Eva (image2). So this fits Barbara.  
C - The girl in option C wears earrings like Anna's (image1), so she fits Anna, not Barbara. So incorrect.  
D - The girl in option D wears a hat similar to Josef's hat (image3), so she fits Josef, not Barbara. So incorrect.

"There are 25 employees in my restaurant. Given the plot below, how much should I pay them today if all employees work 8 hours today?",B,"REASONING: Option A (1808) - Calculate total wage first: 8 employees × $8/hr + 10 employees × $9/hr + 6 employees × $10/hr + 1 employee × $20/hr = (64 + 90 + 60 + 20) = $234 per hour. For 25 employees working 8 hours: 234 × 8 = $1872, so 1808 is incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B (1872) - Matches the calculated total wage: $234/hour × 8 hours = $1872, so this is likely correct.  
REASONING: Option C (1904) - This is slightly above the calculated total ($1872), so seems incorrect.  
REASONING: Option D (1968) - This is even higher than 1904 and does not match the calculation, hence incorrect.

A cuboid is formed from 3 pieces (see <image1>). Each piece is made from 4 cubes of the same colour. What shape does the white piece have? Choose from the options in <image2>.,D,"REASONING: (A) matches the visible white cubes in the cuboid; it has 4 cubes arranged with one cube stacked on three inline cubes, consistent with the placement of white cubes in the image1.  
REASONING: (B) is a flat shape with no vertical stacking, but the white cubes in the cuboid show one cube stacked above others, so (B) does not fit.  
REASONING: (C) has 3 cubes stacked in an L shape but the white cubes in the cuboid show only one cube stacked above three, not two, so (C) is incorrect.  
REASONING: (D) has three cubes in a row with one cube stacked centrally, but the white cubes in the cuboid are stacked on one end, not the middle, so (D) does not match.  
FINAL ANSWER: A",A,A,False,False
"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows a square with three horizontal lines, which does not relate clearly to the previous shapes’ transformations or interactions between circles and squares in the top row.  
REASONING: Option B shows two overlapping circles inside a bigger circle, continuing the theme of interaction between circular shapes, which fits well with the alternating transformations and overlaps seen in the sequence.  
REASONING: Option C shows a face-like pattern with triangles and a circle, unrelated to the geometric transformation or overlap pattern observed in the row above.  
REASONING: Option D represents stacked shapes that do not align with the alternating circle-square configurations or transformations in the pattern.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",D,"REASONING:  
A. The pattern shows an incremental increase in the number of lines connecting points, but option A depicts a closed hexagon, which breaks the increasing complexity trend seen before; option A is too simple and symmetrical compared to the previous figures.  
B. Option B shows an open shape with a distinct 'V' and an additional line, matching the gradual increase of complexity and the turning points in previous figures; it aligns well with the progression of connecting dots.  
C. Option C is smaller and looks more like a minimal shape with fewer lines and dots, which does not follow the progressive building seen in the pattern; it is less complex than prior figures.  
D. Option D shows a shape similar to a rotated version of previous figures but does not feature the increasing complexity or number of connections matching the established sequence; it appears repetitive rather than progressive.

Seven pairwise different single-digit numbers are distributed among the circles shown so that the product of the three numbers that are connected by a straight line is the same in all three cases. Which number is written in the circle with the question mark?,B,"REASONING:  
A: 1 - Using 1 would simplify the product too much and make it difficult to have all products equal with distinct numbers. Also, if 1 is the question mark, it limits the distribution of distinct single-digit numbers.  
B: 2 - If 2 is the question mark, it can balance the product as a low prime factor, potentially allowing equal products across all lines with distinct numbers.  
C: 3 - 3 as the question mark might work but would likely make it harder to maintain the same product in all lines given the need for distinct numbers.  
D: 4 - 4 could be the question mark since 4 is a small composite number and could help balance the product equally across lines with distinct single-digit numbers.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,A,True,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",C,"REASONING: Option A shows a man looking closely at an object in hand; this corresponds well with the ""Origin1"" man looking closely at an insect, so the analogy should be the man actively interacting with the object, similar to the dog holding a bone in the ""Analogy"" image, making this a strong contender.  
REASONING: Option B shows a dog sleeping and not interacting with the object, which is inconsistent with the analogy's active holding of the bone, so this option does not follow the pattern of active engagement.  
REASONING: Option C shows a man eating, which is an active interaction but unrelated to the origin image of closely examining something, and also does not reflect holding or interacting with the same object as in the analogy, making this less relevant.  
REASONING: Option D shows a dog holding a bone, which would mirror the analogy for the human context; however, since the origin1 image depicts a man examining an insect closely, the analogy should be a human engaged similarly with an object, not a dog, so this is inconsistent with the pattern of the analogy.

FINAL ANSWER: A",A,C,False,True
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",A,"REASONING: 
A is incorrect because it shows a similar fiery result as the Origin and Analogy images with burning twigs, so it does not provide a conceptual analogy related to the action shown in Origin'.
B is incorrect because the ferris wheel is unrelated to the concept of fire or burning demonstrated in Origin and Analogy.
C is incorrect because it depicts a smoke or dust cloud, which again does not relate to the act of burning or fire shown in the Origin and Analogy or human actions seen in Origin'.
D is correct because it shows burning logs, which is analogous to fire in the first two pairs and corresponds to the continuation of the fire/burning theme when applied to the human context shown in Origin'.

"Amy made some cookies, as shown in the image. Amy made 2 times as many cookies as Ben made. How many cookies did Ben make?",C,"REASONING: Option A (10) means Amy's cookies would be 2 × 10 = 20; the image shows 24 cookies, so incorrect.  
REASONING: Option B (11) means Amy's cookies would be 2 × 11 = 22; the image shows 24 cookies, so incorrect.  
REASONING: Option C (12) means Amy's cookies would be 2 × 12 = 24; the image shows exactly 24 cookies, so correct.  
REASONING: Option D (13) means Amy's cookies would be 2 × 13 = 26; the image shows 24 cookies, so incorrect.  
FINAL ANSWER: C",C,C,True,True
There are seven squares in the picture. How many more triangles than squares are there in the picture?,C,"REASONING: Option A (1) - If there were only 1 more triangle than 7 squares, that would mean there are 8 triangles. Checking the image, the number of triangles seems more than 8, so this is unlikely.
REASONING: Option B (2) - 7 squares plus 2 gives 9 triangles. Counting the triangles visually in the figure suggests it might be more than 9, so this seems low.
REASONING: Option C (3) - 7 squares plus 3 gives 10 triangles. Visual inspection reveals there are about 10 triangles formed by the lines, making this plausible.
REASONING: Option D (4) - 7 squares plus 4 gives 11 triangles. Counting carefully, there don't appear to be as many as 11 triangles.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",D,"REASONING: A shows a child laughing similar to the origin image but it does not reflect an analogous activity or context like falling, so it's likely incorrect.
REASONING: B shows a person falling off a bike in a snowy or muddy context, similar in theme to the analogy image of a child falling on the snow, making it a fitting analogy for the man laughing (origin prime).
REASONING: C shows a person and a horse laughing together, which does not correspond to the pattern of ""laughing person"" to ""person falling"" analogy, so it is incorrect.
REASONING: D shows a person riding a bike on a trail, but there is no fall or accident depicted, so it does not fit the analogy pattern based on the original set.

"Given the pattern in the first set of blocks at the top of the image, which option at the bottom of the image fits in the question mark in the second set of blocks at the top of the image?",A,"REASONING: The first set shows an arrow curving around a line from left to right then from right to left, a mirror reversal in a vertical flip manner.
Option A shows the same pattern and direction as the first box, so it doesn't fit the mirrored transformation.
Option B shows an inverted pattern, matching the mirrored flip applied in the first set, so it fits the pattern.
Option C is the same as option B but rotated differently and does not fit the mirrored flip applied.
Option D is the same as option A but rotated, so it does not fit the mirrored flip applied.

"Given a pair of chairs arranged at a specific angle, select the option from the four provided that matches the angle of the chairs in the question.",D,"REASONING: Option A shows chairs facing directly forward and backward, which does not match the angle difference in the question.  
REASONING: Option B shows chairs angled similarly to the question, with one chair facing sideways and the other slightly turned, maintaining the same relative angle.  
REASONING: Option C shows chairs facing opposite directions but both looking straight, not matching the angle difference in the question.  
REASONING: Option D shows chairs with different base structures but the angle difference does not correspond to the question's chair angle difference.

"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows a cat walking in the dark with reflective eyes, not matching the posture or activity of the given analogy cat (walking on grass); it does not fit well.
REASONING: Option B shows a cat sniffing or inspecting a bottle, similar in activity to the second origin bear sniffing something; it fits the analogy pattern of a similar animal doing a similar action.
REASONING: Option C is a bear in an environment that doesn't match the analogy cat setting (garbage site vs. grass), and the bear in Origin¹ is sniffing something, so this does not correspond well.
REASONING: Option D shows a polar bear similar to Origin¹, but the analogy requires the counterpart to the cat in a similar sniffing posture, not another polar bear sniffing; thus, it is not the correct analogy.

FINAL ANSWER: B",B,C,True,False
"Based on the relationship between Origin and Analogy, select the option from the candidates that best completes this analogy.",B,"REASONING: Option A shows people walking in a desert terrain, which matches the analogy to the first Origin where people are walking on a desert hill, so it fits the pattern of people walking in dry, sandy terrain.
REASONING: Option B shows a person wading through water, but the analogy relationship pairs vehicles in terrain with people walking in terrain, so this breaks the pattern (people for vehicle, water for dry terrain).
REASONING: Option C shows a Jeep driving through water, which is the same activity as the second Origin, not an analogy like the first pair-to-second pair pattern. This breaks the analogy.
REASONING: Option D shows a vehicle near a water body but stationary, which does not complete the analogy of people walking in terrain corresponding to a vehicle in terrain, so it is inconsistent.

"Lawrence had some 5-ray slices as presented in the image. He glued them together as presented in the image on the right. At minimum, how many slices did he use? ",A,"REASONING:  
A: 3 slices - Each slice has 5 rays, so 3 slices would produce 15 rays, which matches the number of rays in the glued figure on the right. This is a plausible count.  
B: 1 slice - 1 slice has only 5 rays, but the glued figure has many more rays, so this is incorrect.  
C: 9 slices - 9 slices would produce 45 rays, which is too many compared to the glued figure on the right.  
D: 8 slices - 8 slices would produce 40 rays, also too many rays for the glued figure on the right.

"On a table, five polygon cards are stacked as shown, and each card is numbered according to the color shown at the bottom. If we remove the cards one by one from the top of the stack, what is the possible order of the cards being removed? ",D,"REASONING: 
A: 5-1-4-3-2 - The top card is color 5 (gray), matching the stack. Removing cards in this order would mean after removing 5, card 1 should become top, but pink (4) is partially covered by gray (5), so 1 cannot be directly below 5. Incorrect.  
B: 5-4-3-2-1 - After removing 5 (gray) first, a card with color 4 (pink) is next, which is partially covered by 5, so plausible; then 3 (orange), then 2 (light pink), then 1 (green). This order respects the stacking from top to bottom as shown. Correct.  
C: 1-5-3-2-4 - The first card removed is 1 (green), but green (1) is at the bottom in the visible stack, so cannot be first. Incorrect.  
D: 5-4-1-2-3 - After removing 5 (gray), the next is 4 (pink), which is plausible, but then 1 (green) is below pink and orange, so cannot be right after 4 directly. Incorrect.

"Choose the most appropriate option from the four given choices to fill in the question mark, so that the figures follow a pattern.",A,"REASONING: Option A is incorrect because the fourth figure in the second set should have overlapping lines similar to the third figure, and option A shows separate curves without overlapping lines.
REASONING: Option B is incorrect as the pattern involves intersecting or crossing lines forming complex shapes, whereas option B shows a simple branch-like figure that does not match this complexity.
REASONING: Option C is incorrect since the pattern in the second set involves asymmetrical shapes with various intersections, but option C depicts a symmetrical, grid-like shape that doesn't align with the preceding pattern.
REASONING: Option D is correct because it continues the pattern of intersecting lines and shapes seen in the second set, matching the complexity and style of the previous figures and logically following from the third figure.

"Divide the following six figures into two categories, so that each category displays its own pattern.",A,"REASONING:  
A. Group 1: 1,4,6 and Group 2: 2,3,5 - does not form consistent color patterns within the groups (for example, 6 is less consistent with 1 and 4 than with 3 and 5).  
B. Group 1: 1,5,6 and Group 2: 2,3,4 - the first group has mostly black dots on the bottom row or centered black dots, while the second group has different alignment patterns, but 6 and 4 disrupt a clear pattern.  
C. Group 1: 1,2,6 and Group 2: 3,4,5 - In group 1, the black dots are mostly clustered along edges or corners; in group 2, black dots form a more compact central triangle or clustered in the center. This creates a consistent pattern division.  
D. Group 1: 3,6 and Group 2: 2,4,5 - group 1 is small, and group 2 has more varied formations that do not align as well.

The number of spots on the fly agarics (toadstools) shows how many dwarfs fit under it. We can see one side of the fungi. The other side has the same amount of spots. When it rains 36 dwarfs are trying to hide under the fungi. How many dwarfs get wet?,B,"REASONING: Option A (3) is too low because the total spots under all mushrooms are higher, so fewer dwarfs would get wet.  
REASONING: Option B (6) seems low as the total capacity looks larger given the spots count doubled per mushroom.  
REASONING: Option C (12) might fit, but let's verify the total capacity of the mushrooms first.  
REASONING: Option D (18) could fit if the total spots under the mushrooms add up to 18.

Step 1: Count spots on each visible mushroom side:
- First mushroom: 6 spots
- Second mushroom: 5 spots
- Third mushroom: 7 spots
- Fourth mushroom: 4 spots

Step 2: Double each count since the other side has the same number of spots:
- First mushroom: 6 * 2 = 12 spots
- Second mushroom: 5 * 2 = 10 spots
- Third mushroom: 7 * 2 = 14 spots
- Fourth mushroom: 4 * 2 = 8 spots

Step 3: Add all spots (capacity for dwarfs under all mushrooms):
12 + 10 + 14 + 8 = 44 dwarfs can fit under all mushrooms.

Step 4: Since 36 dwarfs are trying to hide and 44 can fit, no one needs to get wet. The question asks how many get wet, so zero dwarfs get wet. But zero is not listed in the options.

Check the question again: It states 36 dwarfs trying to hide under mushrooms with total capacity of 44 dwarfs — so all can hide, no one gets wet.

Is there a trick? The question may want the number not fitting under each mushroom individually, or there's an error in total capacity interpretation.

Check the mushroom that holds the fewest dwarfs (smallest capacity): Fourth mushroom (8 dwarfs).

If the question implies that dwarfs split between mushrooms proportional to spot count, all can fit, no one gets wet.

Since zero is not an option, maybe they want the number of dwarfs who do not fit if only one side counts (since only one side's spots are visible):

Sum spots just on visible side: 6 + 5 + 7 + 4 = 22 dwarfs fit total. 36 dwarfs - 22 spots = 14 dwarfs get wet, still not matching any option.

If only one side counts, 14 dwarfs get wet (no 14 option). If total capacity is 44, none get wet (0).

Possibility: Maybe each spot corresponds to 1 dwarf, but dwarfs need both sides' spots to be covered to be dry.

If dwarfs spread evenly, perhaps half the spots count, 44/2=22 dwarfs fit well.

If 36 dwarfs come, 36 - 22 = 14 get wet (not an option).

Try sum of minimum spots per mushroom: Some mushrooms have 4 spots on visible but same spots on back, so possibly the minimum spot count is actually half total spots.

Try to match one of the options:

Since 36 dwarfs try to hide and total capacity is 44, no dwarfs get wet - but options given do not include zero.

Looking for closest option:

If we subtract capacity of visible spots only (22) from 36 dwarfs, dwarfs getting wet = 14 (not in options).

If we consider the smallest mushroom (8 dwarfs) cannot hold all dwarfs: no logic matches perfectly.

Given options, 18 is the nearest to the difference between dwarfs and capacity of one side (22), but difference is 14, not 18.

Perhaps question means how many dwarfs get wet because only one side of mushroom is visible? Then assuming each mushroom can bear dwarfs = number of spots on visible side * 2 (total number dwarf that can fit). So total spots = 44.

36 can fit, zero get wet.

Since no zero option, possibly the question expects the difference between dwarfs and the visible spots total (22), resulting in 14 dwarfs wet.

None matches 14, pick the closest higher option: 18. 

Hence, the best answer under these constraints:
